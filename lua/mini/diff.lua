--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
---
--- - Visualize difference between buffer text and its configurable reference
---   interactively (updates as you type). This is done per line showing whether
---   it is inside added, changed, or deleted part of difference (called hunk).
---   Visualization can be with customizable colored signs or line numbers.
---
--- - Special toggleable overlay view with more hunk details inside text area.
---   See |MiniDiff.toggle_overlay()|.
---
--- - Completely configurable per buffer source of reference text used to keep
---   it up to date and define interactions with it.
---   See |MiniDiff-source-specification|. By default uses buffer's file content
---   in Git index. See |MiniDiff.gen_source.git()|.
---
--- - Configurable mappings to manage diff hunks:
---     - Apply and reset hunks inside region (selected visually or with
---       a dot-repeatable operator).
---     - "Hunk range under cursor" textobject to be used as operator target.
---     - Navigate to first/previous/next/last hunk. See |MiniDiff.goto_hunk()|.
---
--- What it doesn't do:
---
--- - Provide functionality to work directly with Git outside of visualizing
---   and staging (applying) hunks with (default) Git source. In particular,
---   unstaging hunks is not supported. See |MiniDiff.gen_source.git()|.

---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.diff').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniDiff`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniDiff.*`).
---
--- See |MiniDiff.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minidiff_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniDiff.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim':
---     - Main inspiration for this module, so there are many similarities.
---     - Can display only Git hunks, while this module has extensible design.
---     - Provides more functionality to work with Git outside of hunks.
---       This module does not (by design).
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniDiffSignAdd`     - "add" hunk lines visualization.
--- * `MiniDiffSignChange`  - "change" hunk lines visualization.
--- * `MiniDiffSignDelete`  - "delete" hunk lines visualization.
--- * `MiniDiffOverAdd`     - added text shown in overlay.
--- * `MiniDiffOverChange`  - changed text shown in overlay.
--- * `MiniDiffOverContext` - context of changed text shown in overlay.
--- * `MiniDiffOverDelete`  - deleted text shown in overlay.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To temporarily disable features without relying on |MiniDiff.disable()|,
--- set `vim.g.minidiff_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.minidiff_disable` (for
--- a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios and
--- customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user.
--- See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # Diffs and hunks ~
---
--- The "diff" (short for "difference") is a result of computing how two text
--- strings differ from one another. This is done on per line basis, i.e. the
--- goal is to compute sequences of lines common to both files, interspersed
--- with groups of differing lines (called "hunks").
---
--- Although computing diff is a general concept (used on its own, in Git, etc.),
--- this module computes difference between current text in a buffer and some
--- reference text which is kept up to date specifically for that buffer.
--- For example, default reference text is computed as file content in Git index.
--- This can be customized in `config.source` (see |MiniDiff-source-specification|).
---
---                                                    *MiniDiff-hunk-specification*
--- Hunk describes two sets (one from buffer text, one - from reference) of
--- consecutive lines which are different. In this module hunk is stored as
--- a table with the following fields:
---
--- - <buf_start> `(number)` - start of hunk buffer lines. First line is 1.
---   Can be 0 if first reference lines are deleted.
---
--- - <buf_count> `(number)` - number of consecutive buffer lines. Can be 0 in
---   case reference lines are deleted.
---
--- - <ref_start> `(number)` - start of hunk reference lines. First line is 1.
---   Can be 0 if lines are added before first reference line.
---
--- - <ref_count> `(number)` - number of consecutive reference lines. Can be 0 in
---   case buffer lines are added.
---
--- - <type> `(string)` - hunk type. Can be one of:
---     - "add" - lines are present in buffer but absent in reference.
---     - "change" - lines are present in both buffer and reference.
---     - "delete" - lines are absent in buffer but present in reference.
---
--- # Life cycle ~
---
--- - When entering proper (not already enabled, valid, showing text) buffer,
---   it is attempted to be enabled for diff processing.
--- - During enabling, attempt attaching the source. This should set up how
---   reference text is kept up to date.
--- - On every text change, diff computation is scheduled in debounced fashion
---   after customizable delay (200 ms by default).
--- - After the diff is computed, do the following:
---     - Update visualization based on configurable style: either by placing
---       colored text in sign column or coloring line numbers. Colors for both
---       styles are defined per hunk type in corresponding `MiniDiffSign*`
---       highlight group (see |MiniDiff|) and sign text for "sign" style can
---       be configured in `view.signs` of |MiniDiff.config|.
---     - Update overlay view (if it is enabled).
---     - Update `vim.b.minidiff_summary` and `vim.b.minidiff_summary_string`
---       buffer-local variables. These can be used, for example, in statusline.
---                                                          *MiniDiff-update-event*
---     - Trigger `MiniDiffUpdated` `User` event. See |MiniDiff-diff-summary| for
---       example of how to use it.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Use |:edit| to reset (disable and re-enable) current buffer.
---
--- # Overlay ~
---
--- Along with basic visualization, there is a special view called "overlay".
--- Although it is meant for temporary overview of diff details and can be
--- manually toggled via |MiniDiff.toggle_overlay()|, text can be changed with
--- overlay reacting accordingly.
---
--- It shows more diff details inside text area:
---
--- - Added buffer lines are highlighted with `MiniDiffOverAdd` highlight group.
---
--- - Deleted reference lines are shown as virtual text and highlighted with
---   `MiniDiffOverDelete` highlight group.
---
--- - Changed reference lines are shown as virtual text and highlighted with
---   `MiniDiffOverChange` highlight group.
---
---   "Change" hunks with equal number of buffer and reference lines have special
---   treatment and show "word diff". Reference line is shown next to its buffer
---   counterpart and only changed parts of both lines are highlighted with
---   `MiniDiffOverChange`. The rest of reference line has `MiniDiffOverContext`
---   highlighting.
---   This usually is the case when `config.options.linematch` is enabled.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Word diff has non-zero context width. This means if changed characters
---   are close enough, whole range between them is also colored. This usually
---   reduces visual noise.
--- - Virtual lines above line 1 (like deleted or changed lines) need manual
---   scroll to become visible (with |CTRL-Y|).
---
--- # Mappings ~
---
--- This module provides mappings for common actions with diffs, like:
--- - Apply and reset hunks.
--- - "Hunk range under cursor" textobject.
--- - Go to first/previous/next/last hunk range.
---
--- Examples:
--- - `vip` followed by `gh` / `gH` applies/resets hunks inside current paragraph.
---   Same can be achieved in operator form `ghip` / `gHip`, which has the
---   advantage of being dot-repeatable (see |single-repeat|).
--- - `gh_` / `gH_` applies/resets current line (even if it is not a full hunk).
--- - `ghgh` / `gHgh` applies/resets hunk range under cursor.
--- - `dgh` deletes hunk range under cursor.
--- - `[H` / `[h` / `]h` / `]H` navigate cursor to the first / previous / next / last
---   hunk range of the current buffer.
---
--- Mappings for some functionality are assumed to be done manually.
--- See |MiniDiff.operator()|.
---
--- # Buffer-local variables ~
---                                                          *MiniDiff-diff-summary*
--- Each enabled buffer has the following buffer-local variables which can be
--- used in custom statusline to show an overview of hunks in current buffer:
---
--- - `vim.b.minidiff_summary` is a table with the following fields:
---     - `source_name` - name of the source.
---     - `n_ranges` - number of hunk ranges (sequences of contiguous hunks).
---     - `add` - number of added lines.
---     - `change` - number of changed lines.
---     - `delete` - number of deleted lines.
---
--- - `vim.b.minidiff_summary_string` is a string representation of summary
---   with a fixed format. It is expected to be used as is. To achieve
---   different formatting, use `vim.b.minidiff_summary` to construct one.
---   The best way to do this is by overriding `vim.b.minidiff_summary_string`
---   in the callback for |MiniDiff-update-event| event: >lua
---
---   local format_summary = function(data)
---     local summary = vim.b[data.buf].minidiff_summary
---     local t = {}
---     if summary.add > 0 then table.insert(t, '+' .. summary.add) end
---     if summary.change > 0 then table.insert(t, '~' .. summary.change) end
---     if summary.delete > 0 then table.insert(t, '-' .. summary.delete) end
---     vim.b[data.buf].minidiff_summary_string = table.concat(t, ' ')
---   end
---   local au_opts = { pattern = 'MiniDiffUpdated', callback = format_summary }
---   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', au_opts)

--stylua: ignore
--- Module config
---
--- Default values:
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # View ~
---
--- `config.view` contains settings for how diff hunks are visualized.
--- Example of using custom signs: >lua
---
---   require('mini.diff').setup({
---     view = {
---       style = 'sign',
---       signs = { add = '+', change = '~', delete = '-' },
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- `view.style` is a string defining visualization style. Can be one of "sign"
--- (as a colored sign in a |sign-column|) or "number" (colored line number).
--- Default: "number" if |number| option is enabled, "sign" otherwise.
--- Note: with "sign" style it is usually better to have |signcolumn| always shown.
---
--- `view.signs` is a table with one or two character strings used as signs for
--- corresponding ("add", "change", "delete") hunks.
--- Default: all hunks use "▒" character resulting in a contiguous colored lines.
---
--- `view.priority` is a number with priority used for visualization and
--- overlay |extmarks|.
--- Default: 199 which is one less than `user` in |vim.highlight.priorities| to have
--- higher priority than automated extmarks but not as in user enabled ones.
---
---                                                  *MiniDiff-source-specification*
--- # Source ~
---
--- `config.source` is a table defining how reference text is managed in
--- a particular buffer. It can have the following fields:
--- - <attach> `(function)` - callable which defines how and when reference text
---   should be updated inside a particular buffer. It is called
---   inside |MiniDiff.enable()| with a buffer identifier as a single argument.
---
---   Should execute logic which results into calling |MiniDiff.set_ref_text()|
---   when reference text for buffer needs to be updated. Like inside callback
---   for an |autocommand| or file watcher (see |watch-file|).
---
---   For example, default Git source watches when ".git/index" file is changed
---   and computes reference text as the one from Git index for current file.
---
---   Can return `false` to force buffer to not be enabled. If this can not be
---   inferred immediately (for example, due to asynchronous execution), should
---   call |MiniDiff.disable()| later to disable buffer.
---
---   No default value, should be always supplied.
---
--- - <name> `(string|nil)` - source name. String `"unknown"` is used if not supplied.
---
--- - <detach> `(function|nil)` - callable with cleanup action to be done when
---   buffer is disabled. It is called inside |MiniDiff.disable()| with a buffer
---   identifier as a single argument.
---
---   If not supplied, nothing is done during detaching.
---
--- - <apply_hunks> `(function|nil)` - callable which defines how hunks are applied.
---   It is called with buffer identifier as first argument and array of hunks
---   (see |MiniDiff-hunk-specification|) as second. It should eventually update
---   reference text: either by explicitly calling |MiniDiff.set_ref_text()| or
---   performing action triggering its call.
---
---   For example, default Git source computes patch based on the hunks and
---   applies it inside file's git repo.
---
---   If not supplied, applying hunks throws an error.
---
--- Default: |MiniDiff.gen_source.git()|.
---
--- # Delay ~
---
--- `config.delay` contains settings for delays in asynchronous processes.
---
--- `delay.text_change` is a number (in ms) defining how long to wait after latest
--- text change (in debounced fashion) before updating diff and visualization.
--- Default: 200.
---
--- # Mappings ~
---
--- `config.mappings` contains keys which are mapped during |MiniDiff.setup()|.
---
--- `mappings.apply` keys can be used to apply hunks inside visual/operator region.
--- What exactly "apply hunks" means depends on the source and its `apply_hunks()`.
--- For example, in default Git source it means stage hunks.
---
--- `mappings.reset` keys can be used to reset hunks inside visual/operator region.
--- Reset means replacing buffer text in region with corresponding reference text.
---
--- `mappings.textobject` keys define "hunk range under cursor" textobject
--- which can be used in Operator-pending mode as target for operator (like
--- |d|, |y|, apply/reset hunks, etc.). It is also set up in Visual mode if
--- keys do not conflict with `mappings.apply` and `mappings.reset`.
--- "Hunk range" is used in a sense that contiguous (back-to-back) hunks are
--- considered as parts of a same hunk range.
---
--- `mappings.goto_first` / `mappings.goto_prev` / `mappings.goto_next` /
--- `mappings.goto_last` keys can be used to navigate to first / previous / next /
--- last hunk range in the current buffer.
---
--- # Options ~
---
--- `config.options` contains various customization options.
---
--- `options.algorithm` is a string defining which diff algorithm to use.
--- Default: "histogram". See |vim.diff()| for possible values.
---
--- `options.indent_heuristic` is a boolean defining whether to use indent
--- heuristic for a (possibly) more naturally aligned hunks.
--- Default: `true`.
---
--- `options.linematch` is a number defining hunk size for which a second
--- stage diff is executed for a better aligned and more granular hunks.
--- Note: present only in Neovim>=0.9.
--- Default: 60. See |vim.diff()| and 'diffopt' for more details.
---
--- `options.wrap_goto` is a boolean indicating whether to wrap around edges during
--- hunk navigation (with |MiniDiff.goto_hunk()| or `goto_*` mappings). Like if
--- cursor is after the last hunk, going "next" will put cursor on the first hunk.
--- Default: `false`.
