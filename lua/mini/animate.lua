---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Works out of the box with a single `require('mini.animate').setup()`.
---   No extra mappings or commands needed.
---
--- - Animate cursor movement inside same buffer by showing customizable path.
---   See |MiniAnimate.config.cursor| for more details.
---
--- - Animate scrolling with a series of subscrolls ("smooth scrolling").
---   See |MiniAnimate.config.scroll| for more details.
---
--- - Animate window resize by gradually changing sizes of all windows.
---   See |MiniAnimate.config.resize| for more details.
---
--- - Animate window open/close with visually updating floating window.
---   See |MiniAnimate.config.open| and |MiniAnimate.config.close| for more details.
---
--- - Timings for all actions can be customized independently.
---   See |MiniAnimate-timing| for more details.
---
--- - Action animations can be enabled/disabled independently.
---
--- - All animations are asynchronous/non-blocking and trigger a targeted event
---   which can be used to perform actions after animation is done.
---
--- - |MiniAnimate.animate()| function which can be used to perform own animations.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Cursor movement is animated inside same window and buffer, not as cursor
---   moves across the screen.
---
--- - Scroll and resize animations are done with "side effects": they actually
---   change the state of what is animated (window view and sizes
---   respectively). This has a downside of possibly needing extra work to
---   account for asynchronous nature of animation (like adjusting certain
---   mappings, etc.). See |MiniAnimate.config.scroll| and
---   |MiniAnimate.config.resize| for more details.
---
--- - Although all animations work in all supported versions of Neovim, scroll
---   and resize animations have best experience with Neovim>=0.9. This is due
---   to updated implementation of |WinScrolled| event.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.animate').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniAnimate`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniAnimate.*`).
---
--- See |MiniAnimate.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like `config.modifiers`) locally
--- to buffer inside `vim.b.minianimate_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniAnimate.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - Neovide:
---     - Neovide is a standalone GUI which has more control over its animations.
---       While 'mini.animate' works inside terminal emulator (with all its
---       limitations, like lack of pixel-size control over animations).
---     - Neovide animates cursor movement across screen, while 'mini.animate' -
---       as it moves across same buffer.
---     - Neovide has fixed number of animation effects per action, while
---       'mini.animate' is fully customizable.
---     - 'mini.animate' implements animations for window open/close, while
---       Neovide does not.
--- - 'edluffy/specs.nvim':
---     - 'mini.animate' approaches cursor movement visualization via
---       customizable path function (uses extmarks), while 'specs.nvim' can
---       customize within its own visual effects (shading and floating
---       window resizing).
--- - 'karb94/neoscroll.nvim':
---     - Scroll animation is triggered only inside dedicated mappings.
---       'mini.animate' animates scroll resulting from any window view change.
--- - 'anuvyklack/windows.nvim':
---     - Resize animation is done only within custom commands and mappings,
---       while 'mini.animate' animates any resize out of the box (works
---       similarly to 'windows.nvim' in Neovim>=0.9 with appropriate
---       'winheight' / 'winwidth' and 'winminheight' / 'winminwidth').
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniAnimateCursor` - highlight of cursor during its animated movement.
--- * `MiniAnimateNormalFloat` - highlight of floating window for `open` and
---   `close` animations.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.minianimate_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.minianimate_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
--- number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
--- rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

---                                                             *MiniAnimate-timing*
--- - Every animation is a non-blockingly scheduled series of specific actions.
---   They are executed in a sequence of timed steps controlled by `timing` option.
---   It is a callable which, given next and total step numbers, returns wait time
---   (in ms). See |MiniAnimate.gen_timing| for builtin timing functions.
---   See |MiniAnimate.animate()| for more details about animation process.
---
--- - Every animation can be enabled/disabled independently by setting `enable`
---   option to `true`/`false`.
---
---                                                         *MiniAnimate-done-event*
--- - Every animation triggers custom |User| event when it is finished. It is
---   named `MiniAnimateDoneXxx` with `Xxx` replaced by capitalized supported
---   animation action name (like `MiniAnimateDoneCursor`). Use it to schedule
---   some action after certain animation is completed. Alternatively, you can
---   use |MiniAnimate.execute_after()| (usually preferred in mappings).
---
--- - Each animation has its main step generator which defines how particular
---   animation is done. They all are callables which take some input data and
---   return an array of step data. Length of that array determines number of
---   animation steps. Outputs `nil` and empty table result in no animation.
---
---                                                      *MiniAnimate.config.cursor*
--- # Cursor ~
---
--- This animation is triggered for each movement of cursor inside same window
--- and buffer. Its visualization step consists from placing single extmark (see
--- |extmarks|) at certain position. This extmark contains single space and is
--- highlighted with `MiniAnimateCursor` highlight group.
---
--- Exact places of extmark and their number is controlled by `path` option. It
--- is a callable which takes `destination` argument (2d integer point in
--- `(line, col)` coordinates) and returns array of relative to `(0, 0)` places
--- for extmark to be placed. Example:
--- - Input `(2, -3)` means cursor jumped 2 lines forward and 3 columns backward.
--- - Output `{ {0, 0 }, { 0, -1 }, { 0, -2 }, { 0, -3 }, { 1, -3 } }` means
---   that path is first visualized along the initial line and then along final
---   column.
---
--- See |MiniAnimate.gen_path| for builtin path generators.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Input `destination` value is computed ignoring folds. This is by design
---   as it helps better visualize distance between two cursor positions.
--- - Outputs of path generator resulting in a place where extmark can't be
---   placed are silently omitted during animation: this step won't show any
---   visualization.
---
--- Configuration example: >
---
---   local animate = require('mini.animate')
---   animate.setup({
---     cursor = {
---       -- Animate for 200 milliseconds with linear easing
---       timing = animate.gen_timing.linear({ duration = 200, unit = 'total' }),
---
---       -- Animate with shortest line for any cursor move
---       path = animate.gen_path.line({
---         predicate = function() return true end,
---       }),
---     }
---   })
---
--- After animation is done, `MiniAnimateDoneCursor` event is triggered.
---
---                                                      *MiniAnimate.config.scroll*
--- # Scroll ~
---
--- This animation is triggered for each vertical scroll of current window.
--- Its visualization step consists from performing a small subscroll which all
--- in total will result into needed total scroll.
---
--- Exact subscroll values and their number is controlled by `subscroll` option.
--- It is a callable which takes `total_scroll` argument (single non-negative
--- integer) and returns array of non-negative integers each representing the
--- amount of lines needed to be scrolled inside corresponding step. All
--- subscroll values should sum to input `total_scroll`.
--- Example:
--- - Input `5` means that total scroll consists from 5 lines (either up or down,
---   which doesn't matter).
--- - Output of `{ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 }` means that there are 5 equal subscrolls.
---
--- See |MiniAnimate.gen_subscroll| for builtin subscroll generators.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Input value of `total_scroll` is computed taking folds into account.
--- - As scroll animation is essentially a precisely scheduled non-blocking
---   subscrolls, this has two important interconnected consequences:
---     - If another scroll is attempted during the animation, it is done based
---       on the **currently visible** window view. Example: if user presses
---       |CTRL-D| and then |CTRL-U| when animation is half done, window will not
---       display the previous view half of 'scroll' above it. This especially
---       affects mouse wheel scrolling, as each its turn results in a new scroll
---       for number of lines defined by 'mousescroll'. Tweak it to your liking.
---     - It breaks the use of several relative scrolling commands in the same
---       command. Use |MiniAnimate.execute_after()| to schedule action after
---       reaching target window view.
---       Example: a useful `nnoremap n nzvzz` mapping (consecutive application
---       of |n|, |zv|, and |zz|) should have this right hand side: >
---
---   <Cmd>lua vim.cmd('normal! n'); MiniAnimate.execute_after('scroll', 'normal! zvzz')<CR>
---
--- - This animation works best with Neovim>=0.9 (after certain updates to
---   |WinScrolled| event).
---
--- Configuration example: >
---
---   local animate = require('mini.animate')
---   animate.setup({
---     scroll = {
---       -- Animate for 200 milliseconds with linear easing
---       timing = animate.gen_timing.linear({ duration = 200, unit = 'total' }),
---
---       -- Animate equally but with at most 120 steps instead of default 60
---       subscroll = animate.gen_subscroll.equal({ max_output_steps = 120 }),
---     }
---   })
---
--- After animation is done, `MiniAnimateDoneScroll` event is triggered.
---
---                                                      *MiniAnimate.config.resize*
--- # Resize ~
---
--- This animation is triggered for window resize while having same layout of
--- same windows. For example, it won't trigger when window is opened/closed or
--- after something like |CTRL-W_K|. Its visualization step consists from setting
--- certain sizes to all visible windows (last step being for "true" final sizes).
---
--- Exact window step sizes and their number is controlled by `subresize` option.
--- It is a callable which takes `sizes_from` and `sizes_to` arguments (both
--- tables with window id as keys and dimension table as values) and returns
--- array of same shaped data.
--- Example:
--- - Inputs
---   `{ [1000] = {width = 7, height = 5}, [1001] = {width = 7, height = 10} }`
---   and
---   `{ [1000] = {width = 9, height = 5}, [1001] = {width = 5, height = 10} }`
---   mean that window 1000 increased its width by 2 in expense of window 1001.
--- - The following output demonstrates equal resizing: >
---
---   {
---     { [1000] = {width = 8, height = 5}, [1001] = {width = 6, height = 10} },
---     { [1000] = {width = 9, height = 5}, [1001] = {width = 5, height = 10} },
---   }
---
--- See |MiniAnimate.gen_subresize| for builtin subresize generators.
---
--- Notes:
---
--- - As resize animation is essentially a precisely scheduled non-blocking
---   subresizes, this has two important interconnected consequences:
---     - If another resize is attempted during the animation, it is done based
---       on the **currently visible** window sizes. This might affect relative
---       resizing.
---     - It breaks the use of several relative resizing commands in the same
---       command. Use |MiniAnimate.execute_after()| to schedule action after
---       reaching target window sizes.
--- - This animation works best with Neovim>=0.9 (after certain updates to
---   |WinScrolled| event). For example, resize resulting from effect of
---   'winheight' / 'winwidth' will work properly.
---
--- Configuration example: >
---
---   local is_many_wins = function(sizes_from, sizes_to)
---     return vim.tbl_count(sizes_from) >= 3
---   end
---   local animate = require('mini.animate')
---   animate.setup({
---     resize = {
---       -- Animate for 200 milliseconds with linear easing
---       timing = animate.gen_timing.linear({ duration = 200, unit = 'total' }),
---
---       -- Animate only if there are at least 3 windows
---       subresize = animate.gen_subscroll.equal({ predicate = is_many_wins }),
---     }
---   })
---
--- After animation is done, `MiniAnimateDoneResize` event is triggered.
---
---                               *MiniAnimate.config.open* *MiniAnimate.config.close*
--- # Window open/close ~
---
--- These animations are similarly triggered for regular (non-floating) window
--- open/close. Their visualization step consists from drawing empty floating
--- window with customizable config and transparency.
---
--- Exact window visualization characteristics are controlled by `winconfig`
--- and `winblend` options.
---
--- The `winconfig` option is a callable which takes window id (|window-ID|) as
--- input and returns an array of floating window configs (as in `config`
--- argument of |nvim_open_win()|). Its length determines number of animation steps.
--- Example:
--- - The following output results into two animation steps with second being
---   upper left quarter of a first: >
---
---   {
---     {
---       row      = 0,        col    = 0,
---       width    = 10,       height = 10,
---       relative = 'editor', anchor = 'NW', focusable = false,
---       zindex   = 1,        style  = 'minimal',
---     },
---     {
---       row      = 0,        col    = 0,
---       width    = 5,        height = 5,
---       relative = 'editor', anchor = 'NW', focusable = false,
---       zindex   = 1,        style  = 'minimal',
---     },
---   }
---
--- The `winblend` option is similar to `timing` option: it is a callable
--- which, given current and total step numbers, returns value of floating
--- window's 'winblend' option. Note, that it is called for current step (so
--- starts from 0), as opposed to `timing` which is called before step.
--- Example:
--- - Function `function(s, n) return 80 + 20 * s / n end` results in linear
---   transition from `winblend` value of 80 to 100.
---
--- See |MiniAnimate.gen_winconfig| for builtin window config generators.
--- See |MiniAnimate.gen_winblend| for builtin window transparency generators.
---
--- Configuration example: >
---
---   local animate = require('mini.animate')
---   animate.setup({
---     open = {
---       -- Animate for 400 milliseconds with linear easing
---       timing = animate.gen_timing.linear({ duration = 400, unit = 'total' }),
---
---       -- Animate with wiping from nearest edge instead of default static one
---       winconfig = animate.gen_winconfig.wipe({ direction = 'from_edge' }),
---
---       -- Make bigger windows more transparent
---       winblend = animate.gen_winblend.linear({ from = 80, to = 100 }),
---     },
---
---     close = {
---       -- Animate for 400 milliseconds with linear easing
---       timing = animate.gen_timing.linear({ duration = 400, unit = 'total' }),
---
---       -- Animate with wiping to nearest edge instead of default static one
---       winconfig = animate.gen_winconfig.wipe({ direction = 'to_edge' }),
---
---       -- Make bigger windows more transparent
---       winblend = animate.gen_winblend.linear({ from = 100, to = 80 }),
---     },
---   })
---
--- After animation is done, `MiniAnimateDoneOpen` or `MiniAnimateDoneClose`
--- event is triggered for `open` and `close` animation respectively.

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Check animation activity
---
---@param animation_type string One of supported animation types
---   (entries of |MiniAnimate.config|, like `'cursor'`, etc.).
---
---@return boolean Whether the animation is currently active.
MiniAnimate.is_active = function(animation_type)
  local res = H.cache[animation_type .. '_is_active']
  if res == nil then H.error('Wrong `animation_type` for `is_active()`.') end
  return res
end

--- Execute action after some animation is done
---
--- Execute action immediately if animation is not active (checked with
--- |MiniAnimate.is_active()|). Else, schedule its execution until after
--- animation is done (on corresponding "done event", see
--- |MiniAnimate-done-event|).
---
--- Mostly meant to be used inside mappings.
---
--- Example ~
---
--- A useful `nnoremap n nzvzz` mapping (consecutive application of |n|, |zv|, and |zz|)
--- should have this right hand side: >
---
---   <Cmd>lua vim.cmd('normal! n'); MiniAnimate.execute_after('scroll', 'normal! zvzz')<CR>
---
---@param animation_type string One of supported animation types
---   (as in |MiniAnimate.is_active()|).
---@param action string|function Action to be executed. If string, executed as
---   command (via |vim.cmd()|).

  if not vim.is_callable(callable) then
    H.error('Argument `action` of `execute_after()` should be string or callable.')
  end

  -- Schedule conditional action execution to allow animation to actually take
  -- effect. This helps creating more universal mappings, because some commands
  -- (like `n`) not always result into scrolling.
  vim.schedule(function()
    if MiniAnimate.is_active(animation_type) then
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', { pattern = event_name, once = true, callback = callable })

      callable()
    end
  end)
end

-- Action (step 0) - wait (step 1) - action (step 1) - ...
-- `step_action` should return `false` or `nil` (equivalent to not returning anything explicitly) in order to stop animation.
--- Animate action
---
--- This is equivalent to asynchronous execution of the following algorithm:
--- - Call `step_action(0)` immediately after calling this function. Stop if
---   action returned `false` or `nil`.
--- - Wait `step_timing(1)` milliseconds.
--- - Call `step_action(1)`. Stop if it returned `false` or `nil`.
--- - Wait `step_timing(2)` milliseconds.
--- - Call `step_action(2)`. Stop if it returned `false` or `nil`.
--- - ...
---
--- Notes:
--- - Animation is also stopped on action error or if maximum number of steps
---   is reached.
--- - Asynchronous execution is done with |uv.new_timer()|. It only allows
---   integer parts as repeat value. This has several implications:
---     - Outputs of `step_timing()` are accumulated in order to preserve total
---       execution time.
---     - Any wait time less than 1 ms means that action will be executed
---       immediately.
---
---@param step_action function|table Callable which takes `step` (integer 0, 1, 2,
---   etc. indicating current step) and executes some action. Its return value
---   defines when animation should stop: values `false` and `nil` (equivalent
---   to no explicit return) stop animation timer; any other continues it.
---@param step_timing function|table Callable which takes `step` (integer 1, 2, etc.
---   indicating next step) and returns how many milliseconds to wait before
---   executing this step action.
