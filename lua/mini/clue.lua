--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Implement custom key query process to reach target key combination:
---     - Starts after customizable opt-in triggers (mode + keys).
---
---     - Each key press narrows down set of possible targets.
---       Pressing `<BS>` removes previous user entry.
---       Pressing `<Esc>` or `<C-c>` leads to an early stop.
---       Doesn't depend on 'timeoutlen' and has basic support for 'langmap'.
---
---     - Ends when there is at most one target left or user pressed `<CR>`.
---       Results into emulating pressing all query keys plus possible postkeys.
---
--- - Show window (after configurable delay) with clues. It lists available
---   next keys along with their descriptions (auto generated from descriptions
---   present keymaps and user-supplied clues; preferring the former).
---
--- - Configurable "postkeys" for key combinations - keys which will be emulated
---   after combination is reached during key query process.
---
--- - Provide customizable sets of clues for common built-in keys/concepts:
---     - `g` key.
---     - `z` key.
---     - Window commands.
---     - Built-in completion.
---     - Marks.
---     - Registers.
---
--- - Lua functions to disable/enable triggers globally or per buffer.

--- - |MiniClue-key-query-process|.

--- - |MiniClue.gen_clues|.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Works on all supported versions but using Neovim>=0.9 is recommended.
---
--- - There is no functionality to create mappings in order to clearly separate
---   two different tasks.
---   The best suggested practice is to manually create mappings with
---   descriptions (`desc` field in options), as they will be automatically
---   used inside clue window.
---
--- - Triggers are implemented as special buffer-local mappings. This leads to
---   several caveats:
---     - They will override same regular buffer-local mappings and have
---       precedence over global one.
---
---       Example: having set `<C-w>` as Normal mode trigger means that
---       there should not be another `<C-w>` mapping.
---
---     - They need to be the latest created buffer-local mappings or they will
---       not function properly. Most common indicator of this is that some
---       mapping starts to work only after clue window is shown.
---
---       Example: `g` is set as Normal mode trigger, but `gcc` from |mini.comment|
---       doesn't work right away. This is probably because there are some
---       other buffer-local mappings starting with `g` which were created after
---       mapping for `g` trigger. Most common places for this are in LSP server's
---       `on_attach` or during tree-sitter start in buffer.
---
---       To check if trigger is the most recent buffer-local mapping, execute
---       `:<mode-char>map <trigger-keys>` (like `:nmap g` for previous example).
---       Mapping for trigger should be the first listed.
---
---       This module makes the best effort to work out of the box and cover
---       most common cases, but it is not full proof. The solution here is to
---       ensure that triggers are created after making all buffer-local mappings:
---       run either |MiniClue.setup()| or |MiniClue.ensure_buf_triggers()|.
---
--- - Descriptions from existing mappings take precedence over user-supplied
---   clues. This is to ensure that information shown in clue window is as
---   relevant as possible. To add/customize description of an already existing
---   mapping, use |MiniClue.set_mapping_desc()|.
---
--- - Due to technical difficulties, there is no full proof support for
---   Operator-pending mode triggers (like `a`/`i` from |mini.ai|):
---     - Doesn't work as part of a command in "temporary Normal mode" (like
---       after |i_CTRL-O|) due to implementation difficulties.
---     - Can have unexpected behavior with custom operators.
---
--- - Has (mostly solved) issues with macros:
---     - All triggers are disabled during macro recording due to technical
---       reasons.
---     - The `@` and `Q` keys are specially mapped inside |MiniClue.setup()|
---       to temporarily disable triggers.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.clue').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniClue`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniClue.*`).
---
--- Config table **needs to have triggers configured**, none is set up by default.
---
--- See |MiniClue.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like clues or window options)
--- locally to a buffer inside `vim.b.miniclue_config` which should have same
--- structure as `MiniClue.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for
--- more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'folke/which-key.nvim':
---     - Both have the same main goal: show available next keys along with
---       their customizable descriptions.
---     - Has different UI and content layout.
---     - Allows creating mappings inside its configuration, while this module
---       doesn't have this by design (to clearly separate two different tasks).
---     - Doesn't allow creating submodes, while this module does (via `postkeys`).
---
--- - 'anuvyklack/hydra.nvim':
---     - Both allow creating submodes: state which starts at certain key
---       combination; treats some keys differently; ends after `<Esc>`.
---     - Doesn't show information about available next keys (outside of
---       submodes), while that is this module's main goal.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniClueBorder` - window border.
--- * `MiniClueDescGroup` - group description in clue window.
--- * `MiniClueDescSingle` - single target description in clue window.
--- * `MiniClueNextKey` - next key label in clue window.
--- * `MiniClueNextKeyWithPostkeys` - next key label with postkeys in clue window.
--- * `MiniClueSeparator` - separator in clue window.
--- * `MiniClueTitle` - window title.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling~
---
--- To disable creating triggers, set `vim.g.miniclue_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.miniclue_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
--- of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
--- for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # Key query process ~
---
--- ## General info ~
---
--- This module implements custom key query process imitating a usual built-in
--- mechanism of user pressing keys in order to execute a mapping. General idea
--- is the same: narrow down key combinations until the target is reached.
---
--- Main goals of its existence are:
---
--- - Allow reaching certain mappings be independent of 'timeoutlen'. That is,
---   there is no fixed timeout after which currently typed keys are executed.
---
--- - Enable automated showing of next key clues after user-supplied delay
---   (also independent of 'timeoutlen').
---
--- - Allow emulating configurable key presses after certain key combination is
---   reached. This granular control allows creating so called "submodes".
---   See more at |MiniClue-examples-submodes|.
---
--- This process is primarily designed for nested `<Leader>` mappings in Normal
--- mode but works in all other main modes: Visual, Insert, Operator-pending
--- (with caveats; no full proof guarantees), Command-line, Terminal.
---
--- ## Lifecycle ~
---
--- - Key query process starts when user types a trigger: certain keys in certain
---   mode. Those keys are put into key query as a single user input. All possible
---   mode key combinations are filtered to ones starting with the trigger keys.
---
---   Note: trigger is implemented as a regular mapping, so if it has at least
---   two keys, they should be pressed within 'timeoutlen' milliseconds.
---
--- - Wait (indefinitely) for user to press a key. Advance depending on the key:
---
---     - Special key:
---
---         - If `<Esc>` or `<C-c>`, stop the process without any action.
---
---         - If `<CR>`, stop the process and execute current key query, meaning
---           emulate (with |nvim_feedkeys()|) user pressing those keys.
---
---         - If `<BS>`, remove previous user input from the query. If query becomes
---           empty, stop the process without any action.
---
---         - If a key for scrolling clue window (`scroll_down` / `scroll_up`
---           in `config.window`; `<C-d>` / `<C-u>` by default), scroll clue window
---           and wait for the next user key.
---
---     - Not special key. Add key to the query while filtering all available
---       key combinations to start with the current key query. Advance:
---
---         - If there is a single available key combination matching current
---           key query, execute it.
---
---         - If there is no key combinations starting with the current query,
---           execute it. This, for instance, allows a seamless execution of
---           operators in presence of a longer key combinations. Example: with
---           `g` as trigger in Normal mode and available mappings `gc` / `gcc`
---           (like from |mini.comment|), this allows typing `gcip` to comment
---           current paragraph, although there are no key combinations
---           starting with `gci`.
---
---         - Otherwise wait for the new user key press.
---
--- ## Clue window ~
---
--- After initiating key query process and after each key press, a timer is
--- started to show a clue window: floating window with information about
--- available next keys along with their descriptions. Note: if window is
--- already shown, its content is updated right away.
---
--- Clues can have these types:
---
--- - "Terminal next key": when pressed, will lead to query execution.
---
--- - "Terminal next key with postkeys": when pressed, will lead to query
---   execution plus some configured postkeys.
---
--- - "Group next key": when pressed, will narrow down available key combinations
---   and wait for another key press. Note: can have configured description
---   (inside `config.clues`) or it will be auto generated based on the number of
---   available key combinations.

---       -- Leader triggers
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>' },

---   })
---
--- # Leader clues ~
---
--- Assume there are these |<Leader>| mappings set up: >
---
---   -- Set `<Leader>` before making any mappings and configuring 'mini.clue'
---   vim.g.mapleader = ' '
---
---   local nmap_leader = function(suffix, rhs, desc)
---     vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>' .. suffix, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---   local xmap_leader = function(suffix, rhs, desc)
---     vim.keymap.set('x', '<Leader>' .. suffix, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   nmap_leader('bd', '<Cmd>lua MiniBufremove.delete()<CR>',  'Delete')
---   nmap_leader('bw', '<Cmd>lua MiniBufremove.wipeout()<CR>', 'Wipeout')
---
---   nmap_leader('lf', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.format()<CR>',     'Format')
---   xmap_leader('lf', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.format()<CR>',     'Format')
---   nmap_leader('lr', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>',     'Rename')
---   nmap_leader('lR', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.references()<CR>', 'References')
---
---
--- The following setup will enable |<Leader>| as trigger in Normal and Visual
--- modes and add descriptions to mapping groups: >
---
---   require('mini.clue').setup({
---     -- Register `<Leader>` as trigger
---     triggers = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>' },
---     },
---
---     -- Add descriptions for mapping groups

---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>l', desc = '+LSP' },
---     },
---   })
---
--- # Clues without mappings ~
---
--- Clues can be shown not only for actually present mappings. This is helpful for
--- showing clues for built-in key combinations. Here is an example of clues for
--- a subset of built-in completion (see |MiniClue.gen_clues.builtin_completion()|
--- to generate clues for all available completion sources): >
---
---   require('mini.clue').setup({

---                                                     *MiniClue-examples-submodes*
--- # Submodes ~
---
--- Submode is a state initiated after pressing certain key combination ("prefix")
--- during which some keys are interpreted differently.
---
--- In this module submode can be implemented following these steps:
---
--- - Create mappings for each key inside submode. Left hand side of mappings
---   should consist from prefix followed by the key.
---
--- - Create clue for each key inside submode with `postkeys` value equal to
---   prefix. It would mean that after executing particular key combination from
---   this submode, pressing its prefix will be automatically emulated (leading
---   back to being inside submode).
---
--- - Register submode prefix (or some of its starting part) as trigger.
---
--- ## Submode examples ~
---
--- - Submode for moving with |mini.move|:
---     - Press `<Leader>m` to start submode.
---     - Press any of `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` to move selection/line.
---     - Press `<Esc>` to stop submode.
---
---   The code: >
---
---   require('mini.move').setup({
---     mappings = {
---       left       = '<Leader>mh',
---       right      = '<Leader>ml',
---       down       = '<Leader>mj',
---       up         = '<Leader>mk',
---       line_left  = '<Leader>mh',
---       line_right = '<Leader>ml',
---       line_down  = '<Leader>mj',
---       line_up    = '<Leader>mk',
---     },
---   })
---
---   require('mini.clue').setup({
---     triggers = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>m' },
---     },
---     clues = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>mh', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>mj', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>mk', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<Leader>ml', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>mh', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>mj', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>mk', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---       { mode = 'x', keys = '<Leader>ml', postkeys = '<Leader>m' },
---     },
---   })
---
--- - Submode for iterating buffers and windows with |mini.bracketed|:
---     - Press `[` or `]` to start key query process for certain direction.
---     - Press `b` / `w` to iterate buffers/windows until reach target one.
---     - Press `<Esc>` to stop submode.
---
---   The code: >
---
---   require('mini.bracketed').setup()
---
---   require('mini.clue').setup({
---     triggers = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = ']' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '[' },
---     },
---     clues = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = ']b', postkeys = ']' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = ']w', postkeys = ']' },
---
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '[b', postkeys = '[' },
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '[w', postkeys = '[' },
---     },
---   })
---
--- - Submode for window commands using |MiniClue.gen_clues.windows()|:
---     - Press `<C-w>` to start key query process.
---     - Press keys which move / change focus / resize windows.
---     - Press `<Esc>` to stop submode.
---
---   The code: >
---
---   local miniclue = require('mini.clue')
---   miniclue.setup({
---     triggers = {
---       { mode = 'n', keys = '<C-w>' },

---   set it prior to running |MiniClue.setup()|.
---
--- - See |MiniClue-examples| for examples.
---
--- # Clues ~
---
--- `config.clues` is an array with extra information about key combinations.
--- Each element can be one of:
--- - Clue table.
--- - Array (possibly nested) of clue tables.
--- - Callable (function) returning either of the previous two.
---
--- A clue table is a table with the following fields:
--- - <mode> `(string)` - single character describing **single** mode short-name of
---   key combination as in `nvim_set_keymap()` ('n', 'x', 'i', 'o', 'c', etc.).
--- - <keys> `(string)` - key combination for which clue will be shown.
---   "Human-readable" key names as in |key-notation| (like "<Leader>", "<Space>",
---   "<Tab>", etc.) are allowed.
--- - <desc> `(string|nil)` - optional key combination description which will
---   be shown in clue window.
--- - <postkeys> `(string|nil)` - optional postkeys which will be executed
---   automatically after `keys`. Allows creation of submodes
---   (see |MiniClue-examples-submodes|).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Postkeys are literal simulation of keypresses with |nvim_feedkeys()|.
---
--- - Suggested approach to configuring clues is to create mappings with `desc`
---   field while supplying to `config.clues` only elements describing groups,
---   postkeys, and built-in mappings.
---
--- # Triggers ~
---
--- `config.triggers` is an array with information when |MiniClue-key-query-process|
--- should start. Each element is a trigger table with the fields <mode> and
--- <keys> which are treated the same as in clue table.
---
--- # Window ~
---
--- `config.window` defines behavior of clue window.
---
--- `config.window.delay` is a number of milliseconds after which clue window will
--- appear. Can be 0 to show immediately.
---
--- `config.window.config` is a table defining floating window characteristics.
--- It should have the same structure as in |nvim_open_win()| with the following
--- enhancements:
--- - <width> field can be equal to `"auto"` leading to window width being
---   computed automatically based on its content. Default is fixed width of 30.
--- - <row> and <col> can be equal to `"auto"` in which case they will be
---   computed to "stick" to set anchor ("SE" by default; see |nvim_open_win()|).
---   This allows changing corner in which window is shown: >
---
---   -- Pick one anchor
---   local anchor = 'NW' -- top-left
---   local anchor = 'NE' -- top-right
---   local anchor = 'SW' -- bottom-left
---   local anchor = 'SE' -- bottom-right
---
---   require('mini.clue').setup({
---     window = {
---       config = { anchor = anchor, row = 'auto', col = 'auto' },
---     },
---   })
---
--- `config.window.scroll_down` / `config.window.scroll_up` are strings defining
--- keys which will scroll clue window down / up which is useful in case not
--- all clues fit in current window height. Set to empty string `''` to disable
--- either of them.
