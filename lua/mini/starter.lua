---
--- Displayed items are fully customizable both in terms of what they do and
--- how they look (with reasonable defaults). Item selection can be done using
--- prefix query with instant visual feedback.
---
--- Key design ideas:
--- - All available actions are defined inside items. Each item should have the
---   following info:
---     - <action> - function or string for |vim.cmd| which is executed when
---       item is chosen. Empty string result in placeholder "inactive" item.
---     - <name> - string which will be displayed and used for choosing.
---     - <section> - string representing to which section item belongs.
---   There are pre-configured whole sections in |MiniStarter.sections|.
---
--- - Configure what items are displayed by supplying an array which can be
---   normalized to an array of items. Read about how supplied items are
---   normalized in |MiniStarter.refresh|.
---
--- - Modify the final look by supplying content hooks: functions which take
---   buffer content (see |MiniStarter.get_content()|) and identifier as input
---   while returning buffer content as output. There are pre-configured
---   content hook generators in |MiniStarter.gen_hook|.
---
--- - Choosing an item can be done in two ways:
---     - Type prefix query to filter item by matching its name (ignoring
---       case). Displayed information is updated after every typed character.
---       For every item its unique prefix is highlighted.
---     - Use Up/Down arrows and hit Enter.
---
--- - Allow multiple simultaneously open Starter buffers.
---
--- What is doesn't do:
--- - It doesn't support fuzzy query for items. And probably will never do.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.starter').setup({})`
--- (replace `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
--- `MiniStarter` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
--- `:lua MiniStarter.*`).
---
--- See |MiniStarter.config| for `config` structure and default values. For
--- some configuration examples (including one similar to 'vim-startify' and
--- 'dashboard-nvim'), see |MiniStarter-example-config|.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.ministarter_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniStarter.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
--- Note: `vim.b.ministarter_config` is copied to Starter buffer from current
--- buffer allowing full customization.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniStarterCurrent` - current item.
--- * `MiniStarterFooter` - footer units.
--- * `MiniStarterHeader` - header units.
--- * `MiniStarterInactive` - inactive item.
--- * `MiniStarterItem` - item name.
--- * `MiniStarterItemBullet` - units from |MiniStarter.gen_hook.adding_bullet|.
--- * `MiniStarterItemPrefix` - unique query for item.
--- * `MiniStarterSection` - section units.
--- * `MiniStarterQuery` - current query in active items.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable core functionality, set `vim.g.ministarter_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.ministarter_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
--- of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
--- for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

---     - <CR> executes action of current item.

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Open Starter buffer
---
--- - Create buffer if necessary and move into it.
--- - Set buffer options. Note that settings are done with |noautocmd| to
---   achieve a massive speedup.
--- - Set buffer mappings. Besides basic mappings (described inside "Lifecycle
---   of Starter buffer" of |mini.starter|), map every character from
---   `MiniStarter.config.query_updaters` to add itself to query with
---   |MiniStarter.add_to_query|.
--- - Populate buffer with |MiniStarter.refresh|.
--- - Issue custom `MiniStarterOpened` event to allow acting upon opening
---   Starter buffer. Use it with
---   `autocmd User MiniStarterOpened <your command>`.
---
--- Note: to fully use it in autocommand, use |autocmd-nested|. Example: >lua
---
---   local starter_open = function() MiniStarter.open() end

---   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('TabNewEntered', au_opts)

--- Refresh Starter buffer
---
--- - Normalize `MiniStarter.config.items`:
---     - Flatten: recursively (in depth-first fashion) parse its elements. If
---       function is found, execute it and continue with parsing its output
---       (this allows deferring item collection up until it is actually
---       needed).  If proper item is found (table with fields `action`,
---       `name`, `section`), add it to output.
---     - Sort: order first by section and then by item id (both in order of
---       appearance).
--- - Normalize `MiniStarter.config.header` and `MiniStarter.config.footer` to
---   be multiple lines by splitting at `\n`. If function - evaluate it first.
--- - Make initial buffer content (see |MiniStarter.get_content()| for a
---   description of what a buffer content is). It consist from content lines
---   with single content unit:
---     - First lines contain strings of normalized header.
---     - Body is for normalized items. Section names have own lines preceded
---       by empty line.
---     - Last lines contain separate strings of normalized footer.
--- - Sequentially apply hooks from `MiniStarter.config.content_hooks` to
---   content. All hooks are applied with `(content, buf_id)` signature. Output
---   of one hook serves as first argument to the next.
--- - Gather final items from content with |MiniStarter.content_to_items|.
--- - Convert content to buffer lines with |MiniStarter.content_to_lines| and
---   add them to buffer.
--- - Add highlighting of content units.
--- - Position cursor.
--- - Make current query. This results into some items being marked as
---   "inactive" and updating highlighting of current query on "active" items.
---
--- Note: this function is executed on every |VimResized| to allow more
--- responsive behavior.

-- Work with content ----------------------------------------------------------
--- Get content of Starter buffer
---
--- Generally, buffer content is a table in the form of "2d array" (or rather
--- "2d list" because number of elements can differ):
--- - Each element represents content line: an array with content units to be
---   displayed in one buffer line.
--- - Each content unit is a table with at least the following elements:
---     - "type" - string with type of content. Something like "item",
---       "section", "header", "footer", "empty", etc.
---     - "string" - which string should be displayed. May be an empty string.
---     - "hl" - which highlighting should be applied to content string. May be
---       `nil` for no highlighting.
---
--- See |MiniStarter.content_to_lines| for converting content to buffer lines
--- and |MiniStarter.content_to_items| - to list of parsed items.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Content units with type "item" also have `item` element with all
---   information about an item it represents. Those elements are used directly
---   to create an array of items used for query.

--- Helper to iterate through content
---
--- Basically, this traverses content "2d array" (in depth-first fashion; top
--- to bottom, left to right) and returns "coordinates" of units for which
--- `predicate` is true-ish.
---
---@param content table|nil Content "2d array". Default: content of current buffer.
---@param predicate function|string|nil Predictate to filter units. If it is:
---    - Function, then it is evaluated with unit as input.
---    - String, then it checks unit to have this type (allows easy getting of
---      units with some type).
---    - `nil`, all units are kept.
---
---@return table Array of resulting units' coordinates. Each coordinate is a
---   table with <line> and <unit> keys. To retrieve actual unit from coordinate
---   `c`, use `content[c.line][c.unit]`.
