--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Create colorscheme object: either manually (|MiniColors.as_colorscheme()|)
---   or by querying present color schemes (including currently active one; see
---   |MiniColors.get_colorscheme()|).
---
--- - Infer data about color scheme and/or modify based on it:
---     - Add transparency by removing background color (requires transparency
---       in terminal emulator).
---     - Infer cterm attributes (|cterm-colors|) based on gui colors making it
---       compatible with 'notermguicolors'.
---     - Resolve highlight group links (|:highlight-link|).
---     - Compress by removing redundant highlight groups.
---     - Extract palette of used colors and/or infer terminal colors
---       (|terminal-config|) based on it.
---
--- - Modify colors to better fit your taste and/or goals (see more in
---   |MiniColors-colorscheme-methods|):
---     - Apply any function to color hex string.
---     - Update channels (like lightness, saturation, hue, temperature, red,
---       green, blue, etc.; see more in |MiniColors-channels|).
---       Use either own function or one of the implemented methods:
---         - Add value to channel or multiply it by coefficient. Like "add 10
---           to saturation of every color" or "multiply saturation by 2" to
---           make colors more saturated (less gray).
---         - Invert. Like "invert lightness" to convert between dark/light theme.
---         - Set to one or more values (picks closest to current one). Like
---           "set to one or two hues" to make mono- or dichromatic color scheme.
---         - Repel from certain source(s) with stronger effect for closer values.
---           Like "repel from hue 30" to remove red color from color scheme.
---           Repel hue (how much is removed) is configurable.
---     - Simulate color vision deficiency.
---
--- - Once color scheme is ready, either apply it to see effects right away or
---   write it into a Lua file as a fully functioning separate color scheme.
---
--- - Experiment interactively with a feedback (|MiniColors.interactive()|).
---
--- - Animate transition between color schemes either with |MiniColors.animate()|
---   or with |:Colorscheme| user command.
---
--- - Convert within supported color spaces (|MiniColors.convert()|):
---     - Hex string.
---     - 8-bit number (terminal colors).
---     - RGB.
---     - Oklab, Oklch, Okhsl (https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/).
---
--- Notes:
--- - There is a collection of |MiniColors-recipes| with code snippets for some
---   common tasks.
--- - There is no goal to support as many color spaces as possible, only the
---   already present ones.
---
--- Tweak quick start ~
---
--- - Execute `:lua require('mini.colors').interactive()`.
---
--- - Experiment by writing calls to exposed color scheme methods and applying
---   them with `<M-a>`. For more information, see |MiniColors-colorscheme-methods|
---   and |MiniColors-recipes|.
---
--- - If you are happy with result, write color scheme with `<M-w>`. If not,
---   reset to initial color scheme with `<M-r>`.
---
--- - If only some highlight groups can be made better, adjust them manually
---   inside written color scheme file.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module doesn't need setup, but it can be done to improve usability.
--- Setup with `require('mini.colors').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your
--- `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniColors` which you can
--- use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniColors.*`).
---
--- See |MiniColors.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- This module doesn't have runtime options, so using `vim.b.minicolors_config`
--- will have no effect here.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'rktjmp/lush.nvim':
---     - Oriented towards tweaking separate highlight groups, while 'mini.colors'
---       is more designed to work with color scheme as a whole.
---     - Uses HSL and HSLuv color spaces, while 'mini.colors' uses Oklab, Oklch,
---       and Okhsl which have slightly better perceptual uniformity properties.
---     - Doesn't have functionality to infer and repair missing data in color
---       scheme (like cterm attributes, terminal colors, transparency, etc.),
---       while 'mini.colors' does.
---     - Doesn't implement animation of color scheme transition, while
---       'mini.colors' does.
--- - 'lifepillar/vim-colortemplate':
---     - Comparisons are similar to that of 'rktjmp/lush.nvim'.
--- - 'tjdevries/colorbuddy.nvim':
---     - Comparisons are similar to that of 'rktjmp/lush.nvim'.

--- Recipes for common tasks ~
---
--- All following code snippets assume to be executed inside interactive buffer
--- (|MiniColors.interactively()|). They are directly copy-pasteable.
---
--- To apply single method to current color scheme, use >
---   :lua MiniColors.get_colorscheme():<method goes here>:apply().
---
--- Recipes:
--- - Tweak lightness: >
---
---   -- Invert dark/light color scheme to be light/dark
---   chan_invert('lightness', { gamut_clip = 'cusp' })
---
---   -- Ensure constant contrast ratio
---   chan_set('lightness', 15, { filter = 'bg' })
---   chan_set('lightness', 85, { filter = 'fg' })
---
--- - Tweak saturation: >
---
---   -- Make background colors less saturated and foreground - more
---   chan_add('saturation', -20, { filter = 'bg' })
---   chan_add('saturation', 20,  { filter = 'fg' })
---
---   -- Convert to grayscale
---   chan_set('saturation', 0)
---
--- - Tweak hue: >
---
---   -- Create monochromatic variant (this uses green color)
---   chan_set('hue', 135)
---
---   -- Create dichromatic variant (this uses Neovim-themed hues)
---   chan_set('hue', { 140, 245 })
---
--- - Tweak temperature: >
---
---   -- Invert temperature (make cold theme become warm and vice versa)
---   chan_invert('temperature')
---
---   -- Make background colors colder and foreground warmer
---   chan_add('temperature', -40, { filter = 'bg' })
---   chan_add('temperature', 40,  { filter = 'fg' })
---
--- - Counter color vision deficiency (try combinations of these to see which
---   one works best for you):
---
---     - Improve text saturation contrast (usually the best starting approach): >
---
---       chan_set('saturation', { 10, 90 }, { filter = 'fg' })
--- <
---     - Remove certain hues from all colors (use 30 for red, 90 for yellow,
---       135 for green, 270 for blue): >
---
---       -- Repel red color
---       chan_repel('hue', 30, 45)
--- <
---     - Force equally spaced palette (remove ones with which you know you
---       have trouble): >
---
---       -- Might be a good choice for red-green color blindness
---       chan_set('hue', { 90, 180, 270})
---
---       -- Might be a good choice for blue-yellow color blindness
---       chan_set('hue', { 0, 90, 180 })
--- <
---     - Inverting temperature or pressure can sometimes improve readability: >
---
---       chan_invert('temperature')
---       chan_invert('pressure')
--- <
---     - If all hope is lost, hue random generation might help if you are lucky: >
---
---       chan_modify('hue', function() return math.random(0, 359) end)
--- <
--- - For color scheme creators use |MiniColors-colorscheme:simulate_cvd()| to
---   simulate various color vision deficiency types to see how color scheme
---   would look in the eyes of color blind person.

--- Color space is a way to quantitatively describe a color. In this module
--- color spaces are used both as source for |MiniColors-channels| and inputs
--- for |MiniColors.convert()|
---
--- List of supported color spaces (along with their id in parenthesis):
--- - 8-bit (`8-bit`) - integer between 16 and 255. Usually values 0-15 are also
---   supported, but they depend on terminal emulator theme which is not reliable.
---   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit .
---
--- - Hex (`hex`) - string of the form "#xxxxxx" where `x` is a hexadecimal number.
---
--- - RGB (`rgb`) - table with numeric fields `r` (red), `g` (green), `b` (blue).
---   Visible range is from 0 to 255.
---
--- - Oklab (`oklab`) - table with fields `l` (lightness; numeric in [0; 100]),
---   `a`, `b` (both are unbounded numeric; visible range is usually between
---   -30 to 30). Field `l` describes how light is color; `a` - how "green-red" it is;
---   `b` - how "blue-yellow" it is.
---
--- - Oklch (`oklch`) - table with fields `l` (same as in Oklab),
---   `c` (chroma; positive numeric, visible range usually lower than 32),
---   `h` (`nil` for grays or periodic numeric in [0, 360)). Field `c` describes how
---   colorful a color is; `h` is a value of "true color" on color circle/wheel.
---   NOTE: gray colors, being achromatic by nature, don't have hue.
---
--- - Okhsl (`okhsl`) - Oklch but with `c` replaced by `s` (saturation; numeric
---   in [0; 100]). Field `s` describes a percent of chroma relative to maximum
---   visible chroma for the particular lightness and hue combination. Note,
---   that mathematical model used to compute maximum visible chroma is
---   approximate which might lead to inaccuracies for highly saturated colors
---   with relatively low or high lightness.
---
--- Sources for Oklab/Oklch/Okhsl:
--- - https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/ - initial derivation and
---   introduction of Oklab and Oklch.
--- - https://bottosson.github.io/misc/colorpicker - interactive color picker.
---   Great way for a hands-on introduction to concepts of lightness, chroma,
---   saturation, and hue.
---
---                                                          *MiniColors-gamut-clip*
--- Gamut clip ~
---
--- In Neovim highlight group colors are usually specified by their red, green,
--- and blue values from 0 to 255 in the form of HEX string (see |gui-colors|).
--- Although plenty, these are not all possible colors.
---
--- When performing color manipulation using |MiniColors-colorscheme-methods|,
--- it is possible to end up with "impossible" color (which can't be directly
--- converted to HEX string). For example, inverting lightness of color "#fce094"
--- will lead to a color `{ l = 10, c = 10, h = 90 }` in Oklch space, i.e.
--- "dark yellow" which is impossible to show in HEX.
---
--- **Gamut clipping** is an action of converting color outside of visible gamut
--- (colors representable with HEX string) to be inside it while preserving
--- certain perceptual characteristics as much as possible.
---
--- Gamut clipping in this module is done inside Oklch color space. The goal is to
--- preserve hue as much as possible while manipulating lightness and/or chroma.
---
--- List of supported gamut clip methods (along with their id in parenthesis):
--- - Clip chroma (`'chroma'`) - reduce chroma while preserving lightness until
---   color is inside visible gamut. Default method.
---
--- - Clip lightness (`'lightness'`) - reduce lightness while preserving chroma
---   until color is inside visible gamut.
---
--- - Clip according to "cusp" (`'cusp'`) - reduce both lightness and chroma in
---   a compromise way depending on hue.
---   Cusp is a color with the highest chroma inside slice of visible gamut
---   with the same hue (hue leaf). It is called that way because the slice has
---   a roughly triangular shape with points at (0, 0) - (0, 100) - "cusp" in
---   (chroma, lightness) coordinates.
---   Gamut clipping using "cusp" as reference is done by changing color towards
---   (0, cusp_lightness) point (gray with lightness equal to that of a current
---   cusp) until color is inside visible gamut.
---
--- In short:
--- - Usually `'chroma'` is enough.
--- - If colors are too desaturated - try `'cusp'`.
--- - If still not colorful enough - try `'lightness'`.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Currently implemented formulas are approximate (by design; to reduce code
---   complexity) so there might be problems for highly saturated colors with
---   relatively low or high lightness.
---@tag MiniColors-color-spaces

--- A color channel is a number describing one particular aspect of a color.
--- It is usually direct or modified coordinate of a color space. See
--- |MiniColors-color-spaces| for information on color spaces.
---
--- List of supported channels (along with their id in parenthesis):
--- - Lightness (`lightness`) - corrected `l` component of Oklch. Describes how
---   light is a color. Ranges from 0 (black dark) to 100 (white light).
---
--- - Chroma (`chroma`) - `c` component of Oklch. Describes how colorful is
---   a color in absolute units. Ranges from 0 (gray) to infinity (more like
---   around 30 in practice).
---
--- - Saturation (`saturation`) - `s` component of Okhsl. Describes how colorful
---   is color in relative units. Ranges from 0 (gray) to 100 (maximum saturation
---   for a given lightness-hue pair).
---
--- - Hue (`hue`) - `h` component of Oklch. Describes "true color value" (like
---   red/green/blue) as a number. It is a periodic value from 0 (included) to
---   360 (not included). Best perceived as a degree on a color circle/wheel.
---
---   Approximate values for common color names:
---     - 0   - pink.
---     - 30  - red.
---     - 60  - orange.
---     - 90  - yellow.
---     - 135 - green.
---     - 180 - cyan.
---     - 225 - light blue.
---     - 270 - blue.
---     - 315 - magenta/purple.
---
--- - Temperature (`temperature`) - circular distance from current hue to hue 270
---   angle (blue). Ranges from 0 (cool) to 180 (hot) anchored at hues 270 (blue)
---   and 90 (yellow). Similar to `b` channel but tries to preserve chroma.
---
--- - Pressure (`pressure`) - circular distance from current hue to hue 180.
---   Ranges from 0 (low; green-ish) to 180 (high; red-ish) anchored at hues
---   180 and 0. Similar to `a` channel but tries to preserve chroma.
---   Not widely used; added to have something similar to temperature.
---
--- - a (`a`) - `a` component of Oklab. Describes how "green-red" a color is.
---   Can have any value. Negative values are "green-ish", positive - "red-ish".
---
--- - b (`b`) - `b` component of Oklab. Describes how "blue-yellow" a color is.
---   Can have any value. Negative values are "blue-ish", positive - "yellow-ish".
---
--- - Red (`red`) - `r` component of RGB. Describes how much red a color has.
---   Ranges from 0 (no red) to 255 (full red).
---
--- - Green (`green`) - `g` component of RGB. Describes how much green a color has.
---   Ranges from 0 (no green) to 255 (full green).
---
--- - Blue (`blue`) - `b` component of RGB. Describes how much blue a color has.
---   Ranges from 0 (no blue) to 255 (full blue).

--- Invert value in a channel (see |MiniColors-channels|).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Most Oklab/Oklch inversions are not exactly invertible: applying it twice
---   might lead to slightly different colors depending on gamut clip method
---   (|MiniColors-gamut-clip|) like smaller chroma with default `'chroma'` method.
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {channel} __colors_channel

---   value of a channel and return a new one.
--- {opts} __colors_chan_opts

--- {opts} __colors_chan_opts
---
---                                            *MiniColors-colorscheme:chan_repel()*
--- Repel from certain sources.
---
--- Given an array of repel centers (`sources`) and repel degree (`coef`) add to
--- current channel value some amount ("nudge") with the following properties:
--- - Nudges from several sources are added together.
--- - Nudge is directly proportional to `coef`: bigger `coef` means bigger nudge.
--- - Nudge is inversely proportional to the distance between current value and
---   source: for positive `coef` bigger distance means smaller nudge, i.e.
---   repel effect weakens with distance.
--- - With positive `coef` nudges close to source are computed in a way to remove
---   whole `[source - coef; source + coef]` range.
--- - Negative `coef` results into attraction to source. Nudges in
---   `[source - coef; source + coef]` range are computed to completely collapse it
---   into `source`.
---
--- Examples: >
---
---   -- Repel hue from red color removing hue in range from 20 to 40
---   chan_repel('hue', 30, 10)

--- Set channel to certain value(s). This can be used to ensure that channel has
--- value(s) only within supplied set. If more than one is supplied, closest
--- element to current value is used.
---
--- Parameters ~

--- {values} `(table|number)` Single or multiple values to set.
--- {opts} __colors_chan_opts
---
---                                          *MiniColors-colorscheme:color_modify()*
--- Modify all colors with a callable. It should return new color value (hex
--- string or `nil` to remove attribute) base on the following input:
--- - Current color as hex string.
--- - Data about the color: a table with fields:
---     - <attr> - one of `'fg'`, `'bg'`, `'sp'`, and `'term'` for terminal color.
---     - <name> - name of color source. Either a name of highlight group or
---       string of the form `terminal_color_x` for terminal color (as in
---       |terminal-config|).
---
--- Example: >
---
---   -- Set to '#dd2222' all foreground colors for groups starting with "N"
---   color_modify(function(hex, data)
---     if data.attr == 'fg' and data.name:find('^N') then
---       return '#dd2222'
---     end
---     return hex
---   end)
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {f} `(function)` Callable returning new color value.
---
---                                              *MiniColors-colorscheme:compress()*
--- Remove redundant highlight groups. These are one of the two kinds:
--- - Having values identical to ones after |:hi-clear| (meaning they usually
---   don't add new information).
--- - Coming from a curated list of plugins with highlight groups usually not
---   worth keeping around. Current list of such plugins:
---     - 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons'
---     - 'norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua'
---
--- This method is useful to reduce size of color scheme before writing into
--- the file with |MiniColors-colorscheme:write()|.
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
---   - <plugins> `(boolean)` - whether to remove highlight groups from a curated
---     list of plugins. Default: `true`.
---
---                                           *MiniColors-colorscheme:get_palette()*
--- Get commonly used colors. This basically counts number of all color
--- occurrences and filter out rare ones.
---
--- It is usually a good idea to apply both |MiniColors-colorscheme:compress()|
--- and |MiniColors-colorscheme:resolve_links()| before applying this.
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
---   - <threshold> `(number)` - relative threshold for groups to keep. A group
---     is not included in output if it has less than this many occurrences
---     relative to a total number of colors. Default: 0.01.
---
---                                         *MiniColors-colorscheme:resolve_links()*
--- Resolve links (|:highlight-link|). This makes all highlight groups with `link`
--- attribute have data from a linked one.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Resolves nested links.
--- - If some group is linked to a group missing in current colorscheme object,
---   it is not resolved.
---
---                                          *MiniColors-colorscheme:simulate_cvd()*
--- Simulate color vision deficiency (CVD, color blindness). This is basically
--- a wrapper using |MiniColors.simulate_cvd()| as a part of
--- call to |MiniColors-colorscheme:color_modify()| method.
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {cvd_type} `(string)` One of `'protan'`, `'deutan'`, `'tritan'`, `'mono'`.
--- {severity} `(number|nil)` Severity of CVD, number between 0 and 1. Default: 1.
---
---                                                 *MiniColors-colorscheme:write()*
--- Write color scheme to a file. It will be a Lua script readily usable as
--- a regular color scheme. Useful to both save results of color scheme tweaking
--- and making local snapshot of some other color scheme.
---
--- Sourcing this file on startup usually leads to a better performance that
--- sourcing initial color scheme, as it is essentially a conditioned
--- |:hi-clear| call followed by a series of |nvim_set_hl()| calls.
---
--- Default writing location is a "colors" directory of your Neovim config
--- directory (see |base-directories|). After writing, it should be available
--- for sourcing with |:colorscheme| or |:Colorscheme|.
---
--- Name of the file by default is taken from `name` field (`'mini_colors'` is
--- used if it is `nil`). If color scheme with this name already exists, it
--- appends prefix based on current time to make it unique.
---
--- Notes:
--- - If colors were updated, it is usually a good idea to infer cterm attributes
---   with |MiniColors-colorscheme:add_cterm_attributes()| prior to writing.
---
--- Parameters ~
--- {opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
---   - <compress> `(boolean)` - whether to call |MiniColors-colorscheme:compress()|
---     prior to writing. Default: `true`.
---   - <name> `(string|nil)` - basename of written file. Default: `nil` to infer
---     from `name` field.
---   - <directory> `(string)` - directory to where file should be saved.
---     Default: "colors" subdirectory of Neovim home config (`stdpath("config")`).

--- Start interactive experiments
---
--- Create a special buffer in which user can write plain Lua code to tweak
--- color scheme and apply to get visual feedback.
---
--- General principles ~
--- - Initial colorscheme object is fixed to interactive buffer on its creation.
---
--- - There are special buffer convenience mappings:
---     - Apply (source) current buffer content.
---     - Reset color scheme (make initial colorscheme the current one).
---     - Write to a file the result of applying current buffer content.
---       This sources current content and calls |MiniColors-colorscheme:write()|.
---     - Quit interactive buffer.
---
--- - User is expected to iteratively tweak color scheme by writing general Lua
---   code in interactive buffer and applying it using convenience mapping.
---
--- - Application of interactive buffer is essentially these steps:
---     - Expose `self` as initial colorscheme object on any application.
---       It is always the same for every application.
---     - Expose initial colorscheme methods as standalone functions. So instead
---       of writing `self = self:add_transparency()` user can only write
---       `add_transparency()`.
---     - Source buffer content as plain Lua code.
---
--- Example of interactive buffer content: >
---
---   chan_modify('hue', function() return math.random(0, 359) end)
---   simulate_cvd('protan')
---   add_cterm_attributes()
---   add_terminal_colors()

---       - <Apply> `(string)` - apply buffer code. Default: `'<M-a>'`.
---       - <Reset> `(string)` - apply initial color scheme as is. Default: `'<M-r>'`.
---       - <Quit> `(string)` - close interactive buffer. Default: `'<M-q>'`.
---       - <Write> `(string)` - write result of buffer code into a file.
---         Prompts for file name with |vim.ui.input()| and then
---         uses |MiniColors-colorscheme:write()| with other options being default.
