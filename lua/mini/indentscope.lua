--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Indent scope (or just "scope") is a maximum set of consecutive lines which
--- contains certain reference line (cursor line by default) and every member
--- has indent not less than certain reference indent ("indent at cursor" by
--- default: minimum between cursor column and indent of cursor line).
---
--- Features:
--- - Visualize scope with animated vertical line. It is very fast and done
---   automatically in a non-blocking way (other operations can be performed,
---   like moving cursor). You can customize debounce delay and animation rule.
---
--- - Customization of scope computation options can be done on global level
---   (in |MiniIndentscope.config|), for a certain buffer (using
---   `vim.b.miniindentscope_config` buffer variable), or within a call (using
---   `opts` variable in |MiniIndentscope.get_scope|).
---
--- - Customizable notion of a border: which adjacent lines with strictly lower
---   indent are recognized as such. This is useful for a certain filetypes
---   (for example, Python or plain text).
---
--- - Customizable way of line to be considered "border first". This is useful
---   if you want to place cursor on function header and get scope of its body.
---
--- - There are textobjects and motions to operate on scope. Support |count|
---   and dot-repeat (in operator pending mode).
---
--- # Setup~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.indentscope').setup({})`
--- (replace `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
--- `MiniIndentscope` which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua
--- MiniIndentscope.*`).
---
--- See |MiniIndentscope.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.miniindentscope_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniIndentscope.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons~
---
--- - 'lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim':
---     - Its main functionality is about showing static guides of indent levels.
---     - Implementation of 'mini.indentscope' is similar to
---       'indent-blankline.nvim' (using |extmarks| on first column to be shown
---       even on blank lines). They can be used simultaneously, but it will
---       lead to one of the visualizations being on top (hiding) of another.
---
--- # Highlight groups~
---
--- * `MiniIndentscopeSymbol` - symbol showing on every line of scope if its
---   indent is multiple of 'shiftwidth'.
--- * `MiniIndentscopeSymbolOff` - symbol showing on every line of scope if its
---   indent is not multiple of 'shiftwidth'.
---   Default: links to `MiniIndentscopeSymbol`.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling~
---
--- To disable autodrawing, set `vim.g.miniindentscope_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.miniindentscope_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
--- number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
--- rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- Drawing of scope indicator
---
--- Draw of scope indicator is done as iterative animation. It has the
--- following design:
--- - Draw indicator on origin line (where cursor is at) immediately. Indicator
---   is visualized as `MiniIndentscope.config.symbol` placed to the right of
---   scope's border indent. This creates a line from top to bottom scope edges.
--- - Draw upward and downward concurrently per one line. Progression by one
---   line in both direction is considered to be one step of animation.
--- - Before each step wait certain amount of time, which is decided by
---   "animation function". It takes next and total step numbers (both are one
---   or bigger) and returns number of milliseconds to wait before drawing next
---   step. Comparing to a more popular "easing functions" in animation (input:
---   duration since animation start; output: percent of animation done), it is
---   a discrete inverse version of its derivative. Such interface proved to be
---   more appropriate for kind of task at hand.
---
--- Special cases~
---
--- - When scope to be drawn intersects (same indent, ranges overlap) currently
---   visible one (at process or finished drawing), drawing is done immediately
---   without animation. With most common example being typing new text, this
---   feels more natural.
--- - Scope for the whole buffer is not drawn as it is isually redundant.
---   Technically, it can be thought as drawn at column 0 (because border
---   indent is -1) which is not visible.

end

--- Module config
---
--- Default values:
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # Options ~
---
--- - Options can be supplied globally (from this `config`), locally to buffer
---   (via `options` field of `vim.b.miniindentscope_config` buffer variable),
---   or locally to call (as argument to |MiniIndentscope.get_scope()|).
---
--- - Option `border` controls which line(s) with smaller indent to categorize
---   as border. This matters for textobjects and motions.
---   It also controls how empty lines are treated: they are included in scope
---   only if followed by a border. Another way of looking at it is that indent
---   of blank line is computed based on value of `border` option.
---   Here is an illustration of how `border` works in presense of empty lines:
--- >
---                              |both|bottom|top|none|
---   1|function foo()           | 0  |  0   | 0 | 0  |
---   2|                         | 4  |  0   | 4 | 0  |
---   3|    print('Hello world') | 4  |  4   | 4 | 4  |
---   4|                         | 4  |  4   | 2 | 2  |
---   5|  end                    | 2  |  2   | 2 | 2  |
--- <
---   Numbers inside a table are indent values of a line computed with certain
---   value of `border`. So, for example, a scope with reference line 3 and
---   right-most column has body range depending on value of `border` option:
---     - `border` is "both":   range is 2-4, border is 1 and 5 with indent 2.
---     - `border` is "top":    range is 2-3, border is 1 with indent 0.
---     - `border` is "bottom": range is 3-4, border is 5 with indent 0.
---     - `border` is "none":   range is 3-3, border is empty with indent `nil`.
---
--- - Option `indent_at_cursor` controls if cursor position should affect
---   computation of scope. If `true`, reference indent is a minimum of
---   reference line's indent and cursor column. In main example, here how
---   scope's body range differs depending on cursor column and `indent_at_cursor`
---   value (assuming cursor is on line 3 and it is whole buffer):
--- >
---     Column\Option true|false
---        1 and 2    2-5 | 2-4
---      3 and more   2-4 | 2-4
--- <
--- - Option `try_as_border` controls how to act when input line can be
---   recognized as a border of some neighbor indent scope. In main example,
---   when input line is 1 and can be recognized as border for inner scope,
---   value `try_as_border = true` means that inner scope will be returned.
---   Similar, for input line 5 inner scope will be returned if it is
---   recognized as border.

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Compute indent scope
---
--- Indent scope (or just "scope") is a maximum set of consecutive lines which
--- contains certain reference line (cursor line by default) and every member
--- has indent not less than certain reference indent ("indent at column" by
--- default). Here "indent at column" means minimum between input column value
--- and indent of reference line. When using cursor column, this allows for a
--- useful interactive view of nested indent scopes by making horizontal
--- movements within line.
---
--- Options controlling actual computation is taken from these places in order:
--- - Argument `opts`. Use it to ensure independence from other sources.
--- - Buffer local variable `vim.b.miniindentscope_config` (`options` field).
---   Useful to define local behavior (for example, for a certain filetype).
--- - Global options from |MiniIndentscope.config|.
---
--- Algorithm overview~
---
--- - Compute reference "indent at column". Reference line is an input `line`
---   which might be modified to one of its neighbors if `try_as_border` option
---   is `true`: if it can be viewed as border of some neighbor scope, it will.
--- - Process upwards and downwards from reference line to search for line with
---   indent strictly less than reference one. This is like casting rays up and
---   down from reference line and reference indent until meeting "a wall"
---   (character to the right of indent or buffer edge). Latest line before
---   meeting is a respective end of scope body. It always exists because
---   reference line is a such one.
--- - Based on top and bottom lines with strictly lower indent, construct
---   scopes's border. The way it is computed is decided based on `border`
---   option (see |MiniIndentscope.config| for more information).
--- - Compute border indent as maximum indent of border lines (or reference
---   indent minus one in case of no border). This is used during drawing
---   visual indicator.
---
--- Indent computation~
---
--- For every line indent is intended to be computed unambiguously:
--- - For "normal" lines indent is an output of |indent()|.
--- - Indent is `-1` for imaginary lines 0 and past last line.
--- - For blank and empty lines indent is computed based on previous
---   (|prevnonblank()|) and next (|nextnonblank()|) non-blank lines. The way
---   it is computed is decided based on `border` in order to not include blank
---   lines at edge of scope's body if there is no border there. See
---   |MiniIndentscope.config| for a details example.
---
---@param line number|nil Input line number (starts from 1). Can be modified to a
---   neighbor if `try_as_border` is `true`. Default: cursor line.
---@param col number|nil Column number (starts from 1). Default: if
---   `indent_at_cursor` option is `true` - cursor column from `curswant` of
---   |getcurpos()| (allows for more natural behavior on empty lines);
---   `math.huge` otherwise in order to not incorporate cursor in computation.
---@param opts table|nil Options to override global or buffer local ones (see
---   |MiniIndentscope.config|).
---
---@return table Table with scope information:
---   - <body> - table with <top> (top line of scope, inclusive), <bottom>

---   - <border> - table with <top> (line of top border, might be `nil`),
---     <bottom> (line of bottom border, might be `nil`), and <indent> (indent
---     of border) keys. Line numbers start at 1.
---   - <buf_id> - identifier of current buffer.
---   - <reference> - table with <line> (reference line), <column> (reference
---     column), and <indent> ("indent at column") keys.
