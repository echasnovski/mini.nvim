--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Install, create 'init.lua', add `require('mini.basics').setup()` and you
--- are good to go.
---
--- Features:
--- - Presets for common options. It will only change option if it wasn't
---   manually set before. See more in |MiniBasics.config.options|.
---
--- - Presets for common mappings. It will only add a mapping if it wasn't
---   manually created before. See more in |MiniBasics.config.mappings|.
---
--- - Presets for common autocommands. See more in |MiniBasics.config.autocommands|.
---
--- - Reverse compatibility is a high priority. Any decision to change already
---   present behavior will be made with great care.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Main goal of this module is to provide a relatively easier way for
---   new-ish Neovim users to have better "works out of the box" experience
---   while having documented relevant options/mappings/autocommands to study.
---   It is based partially on survey among Neovim users and partially is
---   coming from personal preferences.
---
---   However, more seasoned users almost surely will find something useful.
---
---   Still, it is recommended to read about used options/mappings/autocommands
---   and decide if they are needed. The main way to do that is by reading
---   Neovim's help pages (linked in help file) and this module's source code
---   (thoroughly documented for easier comprehension).
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.basics').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniBasics`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniBasics.*`).
---
--- See |MiniBasics.config| for available config settings.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'tpope/vim-sensible':
---     - Most of 'tpope/vim-sensible' is already incorporated as default
---       options in Neovim (see |nvim-default|). This module has a much
---       broader effect.
--- - 'tpope/vim-unimpaired':
---     - The 'tpope/vim-unimpaired' has mapping for toggling options with `yo`
---       prefix. This module implements similar functionality with `\` prefix
---       (see |MiniBasics.config.mappings|).

---@diagnostic disable:undefined-field

-- To study source behind presets, search for:
-- - `-- Options ---` for `config.options`.
-- - `-- Mappings ---` for `config.mappings`.
-- - `-- Autocommands ---` for `config.autocommands`.

--- # Options ~
---
--- Usage example: >
---   require('mini.basics').setup({
---     options = {
---       basic = true,
---       extra_ui = true,
---       win_borders = 'double',
---     }
---   })
---
--- ## options.basic ~
---
--- The `config.options.basic` sets certain options to values which are quite
--- commonly used (judging by study of available Neovim pre-configurations,
--- public dotfiles, and surveys).
--- Any option is changed only if it was not set manually beforehand.
--- For exact changes, please see source code ('lua/mini/basics.lua').
---
--- Here is the list of affected options (put cursor on it and press |CTRL-]|):
--- - General:
---     - Sets |<Leader>| key to |<Space>|. Be sure to make all Leader mappings
---       after this (otherwise they are made with default <Leader>).
---     - Runs `:filetype plugin indent on` (see |:filetype-overview|)
---     - |backup|
---     - |mouse|
---     - |undofile|
---     - |writebackup|
--- - Appearance
---     - |breakindent|
---     - |cursorline|
---     - |fillchars|
---     - |linebreak|
---     - |number|
---     - |ruler|
---     - |showmode|
---     - |signcolumn|
---     - |shortmess|
---     - |splitbelow|
---     - |splitkeep| (on Neovim>=0.9)
---     - |splitright|
---     - |termguicolors| (on Neovim<0.10; later versions have it smartly enabled)
---     - |wrap|
--- - Editing
---     - |completeopt|
---     - |formatoptions|
---     - |ignorecase|
---     - |incsearch|
---     - |infercase|
---     - |smartcase|
---     - |smartindent|
---     - |virtualedit|
---
--- ## options.extra_ui ~
---
--- The `config.options.extra_ui` sets certain options for visual appearance
--- which might not be aligned with common preferences, but still worth trying.
--- Any option is changed only if it was not set manually beforehand.
--- For exact changes, please see source code ('lua/mini/basics.lua').
---
--- List of affected options:
--- - |list|
--- - |listchars|
--- - |pumblend|
--- - |pumheight|
--- - |winblend|
--- - Runs `:syntax on` (see |:syntax-on|)
---
--- ## options.win_borders
---
--- The `config.options.win_borders` updates |fillchars| to have a consistent set of
--- characters for window border (`vert`, `horiz`, etc.).
---
--- Available values:
--- - `'bold'` - bold lines.
--- - `'dot'` - dot in every cell.
--- - `'double'` - double line.
--- - `'single'` - single line.
--- - `'solid'` - no symbol, only background.
---
---                                                     *MiniBasics.config.mappings*
--- # Mappings ~
---
--- Usage example: >
---   require('mini.basics').setup({
---     mappings = {
---       basic = true,
---       option_toggle_prefix = [[\]],
---       windows = true,
---       move_with_alt = true,
---     }
---   })
---
--- If you don't want only some mappings to be made at all, use |vim.keymap.del()|
--- after calling |MiniMisc.setup()|. For example, to delete `<C-w>` mapping in
--- |Terminal-mode| (as it conflicts with `<C-w>` usage in terminal emulators)
--- use this code: >
---
---   vim.keymap.del('t', '<C-w>').
---
--- ## mappings.basic ~
---
--- The `config.mappings.basic` creates mappings for certain commonly mapped actions
--- (judging by study of available Neovim pre-configurations and public dotfiles).
---
--- Some of the mappings override built-in ones to either improve their
--- behavior or override its default not very useful action.
--- It will only add a mapping if it wasn't manually created before.
---
--- Here is a table with created mappings : >
---
---  |Keys   |     Modes       |                  Description                  |
---  |-------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
---  | j     | Normal, Visual  | Move down by visible lines with no [count]    |
---  | k     | Normal, Visual  | Move up by visible lines with no [count]      |
---  | go    | Normal          | Add [count] empty lines after cursor          |
---  | gO    | Normal          | Add [count] empty lines before cursor         |
---  | gy    | Normal, Visual  | Copy to system clipboard                      |
---  | gp    | Normal, Visual  | Paste from system clipboard                   |
---  | gV    | Normal          | Visually select latest changed or yanked text |
---  | g/    | Visual          | Search inside current visual selection        |
---  | *     | Visual          | Search forward for current visual selection   |
---  | #     | Visual          | Search backward for current visual selection  |
---  | <C-s> | Normal, Visual, | Save and go to Normal mode                    |
---  |       |     Insert      |                                               |
--- <
--- Notes:
--- - See |[count]| for its meaning.
--- - On Neovim>=0.10 mappings for `#` and `*` are not created as their
---   enhanced variants are made built-in. See |v_star-default| and |v_#-default|.
---
--- ## mappings.option_toggle_prefix ~
---
--- The `config.mappings.option_toggle_prefix` defines a prefix used for
--- creating mappings that toggle common options. The result mappings will be
--- `<prefix> + <suffix>`. For example, with default value, `\w` will toggle |wrap|.
---
--- Other viable choices for prefix are
--- - `,` (as a mnemonic for several values to toggle).
--- - `|` (as a same mnemonic).
--- - `yo` (used in 'tpope/vim-unimpaired')
--- - Something with |<Leader>| key, like `<Leader>t` (`t` for "toggle"). Note:
---   if your prefix contains `<Leader>` key, make sure to set it before
---   calling |MiniBasics.setup()| (as is done with default `basic` field of
---   |MiniBasics.config.options|).
---
--- After toggling, there will be a feedback about the current option value if
--- prior to `require('mini.basics').setup()` module wasn't silenced (see
--- "Silencing" section in |mini.basics|).
---
--- It will only add a mapping if it wasn't manually created before.
---
--- Here is a list of suffixes for created toggling mappings (all in Normal mode):
---
--- - `b` - |'background'|.
--- - `c` - |'cursorline'|.
--- - `C` - |'cursorcolumn'|.
--- - `d` - diagnostic (via |vim.diagnostic.enable()| and |vim.diagnostic.disable()|).
--- - `h` - |'hlsearch'| (or |v:hlsearch| to be precise).
--- - `i` - |'ignorecase'|.
--- - `l` - |'list'|.
--- - `n` - |'number'|.
--- - `r` - |'relativenumber'|.
--- - `s` - |'spell'|.
--- - `w` - |'wrap'|.
---
--- ## mappings.windows ~
---
--- The `config.mappings.windows` creates mappings for easiere window manipulation.
---
--- It will only add a mapping if it wasn't manually created before.
---
--- Here is a list with created Normal mode mappings (all mappings respect |[count]|):
--- - Window navigation:
---     - `<C-h>` - focus on left window (see |CTRL-W_H|).
---     - `<C-j>` - focus on below window (see |CTRL-W_J|).
---     - `<C-k>` - focus on above window (see |CTRL-W_K|).
---     - `<C-l>` - focus on right window (see |CTRL-W_L|).
--- - Window resize (all use arrow keys; variants of |resize|; all respect |[count]|):
---     - `<C-left>`  - decrease window width.
---     - `<C-down>`  - decrease window height.
---     - `<C-up>`    - increase window height.
---     - `<C-right>` - increase window width.
---
--- ## mappings.move_with_alt
---
--- The `config.mappings.move_with_alt` creates mappings for a more consistent
--- cursor move in Insert, Command, and Terminal modes. For example, it proves
--- useful in combination of autopair plugin (like |MiniPairs|) to move right
--- outside of inserted pairs (no matter what the pair is).
---
--- It will only add a mapping if it wasn't manually created before.
---
--- Here is a list of created mappings (`<M-x>` means `Alt`/`Meta` plus `x`):
--- - `<M-h>` - move cursor left.  Modes: Insert, Terminal, Command.
--- - `<M-j>` - move cursor down.  Modes: Insert, Terminal.
--- - `<M-k>` - move cursor up.    Modes: Insert, Terminal.
--- - `<M-l>` - move cursor right. Modes: Insert, Terminal, Command.
---
---                                                 *MiniBasics.config.autocommands*
--- # Autocommands ~
---
--- Usage example: >
---   require('mini.basics').setup({
---     autocommands = {
---       basic = true,
---       relnum_in_visual_mode = true,
---     }
---   })
---
--- ## autocommands.basic ~
---
--- The `config.autocommands.basic` creates some common autocommands:
---
--- - Starts insert mode when opening terminal (see |startinsert| and |TermOpen|).
--- - Highlights yanked text for a brief period of time (see
---   |vim.highlight.on_yank()| and |TextYankPost|).
---
--- ## autocommands.relnum_in_visual_mode ~
---
--- The `config.autocommands.relnum_in_visual_mode` creates autocommands that
--- enable |relativenumber| in linewise and blockwise Visual modes and disable
--- otherwise. See |ModeChanged|.
