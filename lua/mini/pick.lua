--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
---
--- - Single window general purpose interface for picking element from any array.
---
--- - On demand toggleable preview and info views.
---
--- - Interactive query matching (filter+sort) with fast non-blocking default
---   which does fuzzy matching and allows other modes (|MiniPick.default_match()|).
---
--- - Built-in pickers (see |MiniPick.builtin|):
---     - Files.
---     - Pattern match (for fixed pattern and with live feedback).
---     - Buffers.
---     - Help tags.
---     - CLI output.
---     - Resume latest picker.
---
--- - |:Pick| command to work with extensible |MiniPick.registry|.
---
--- - |vim.ui.select()| wrapper (see |MiniPick.ui_select()|).
---
--- - Rich and customizable built-in |MiniPick-actions| when picker is active:
---     - Manually change currently focused item.
---     - Scroll vertically and horizontally.
---     - Toggle preview or info view.
---     - Mark/unmark items to choose later.
---     - Refine current matches (make them part of a new picker).
---     - And many more.
---
--- - Minimal yet flexible |MiniPick-source| specification with:
---     - Items (array, callable, or manually set later).
---     - Source name.
---     - Working directory.
---     - Matching algorithm.
---     - Way matches are shown in main window.
---     - Item preview.
---     - "On choice" action for current and marked items.
---
--- - Custom actions/keys can be configured globally, per buffer, or per picker.
---
--- - Out of the box support for 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'.
---
--- - Match caching to increase responsiveness on repeated prompts.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Works on all supported versions but using Neovim>=0.9 is recommended.
---   Neovim>=0.10 will give more visual feedback in floating window footer.

--- # Dependencies ~
---
--- Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality, will work without them):
---
--- - Plugin 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for filetype icons near the items
---   representing actual paths. If missing, default or no icons will be used.
---
---                                                             *MiniPick-cli-tools*
--- - CLI tool(s) to power |MiniPick.builtin.files()|, |MiniPick.builtin.grep()|, and
---   |MiniPick.builtin.grep_live()| built-in pickers:
---     - `rg` (github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep; enough for all three; recommended).
---     - `fd` (github.com/sharkdp/fd; for `files` only).
---     - `git` (github.com/git/git; enough for all three).
---
---   Note: CLI tools are called only with basic arguments needed to get items.
---   To customize the output, use their respective configuration approaches.
---   Here are some examples of where to start:
---     - github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration-file
---     - github.com/sharkdp/fd#excluding-specific-files-or-directories
---     - git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.pick').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniPick`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniPick.*`).
---
--- See |MiniPick.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minipick_config` which should have same structure as `MiniPick.config`.
--- See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim':
---     - The main inspiration for this module, so there is significant overlap.
---     - Has three (or two) window UI (prompt, matches, preview), while this
---       module combines everything in one window. It allows more straightforward
---       customization for unusual scenarios.
---     - Default match algorithm is somewhat slow, while this module should
---       match relatively lag-free for at least 100K+ items.
---     - Has many built-in pickers, while this module has handful at its core
---       relying on other 'mini.nvim' modules to provide more (see |MiniExtra|).
---
--- - 'ibhagwan/fzf-lua':
---     - Mostly same comparison as with 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'.
---     - Requires 'junegunn/fzf' installed to power fuzzy matching, while this
---       module provides built-in Lua matching.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniPickBorder` - window border.
--- * `MiniPickBorderBusy` - window border while picker is busy processing.
--- * `MiniPickBorderText` - non-prompt on border.
--- * `MiniPickIconDirectory` - default icon for directory.
--- * `MiniPickIconFile` - default icon for file.
--- * `MiniPickHeader` - headers in info buffer and previews.
--- * `MiniPickMatchCurrent` - current matched item.
--- * `MiniPickMatchMarked` - marked matched items.
--- * `MiniPickMatchRanges` - ranges matching query elements.
--- * `MiniPickNormal` - basic foreground/background highlighting.
--- * `MiniPickPreviewLine` - target line in preview.
--- * `MiniPickPreviewRegion` - target region in preview.
--- * `MiniPickPrompt` - prompt.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

--- Events ~
---
--- To allow user customization and integration of external tools, certain |User|
--- autocommand events are triggered under common circumstances:
---
--- - `MiniPickStart` - just after picker has started.
--- - `MiniPickStop` - just before picker is stopped.
---@tag MiniPick-events

--- # Overview ~
---
--- General idea is to take array of objects, display them with interactive
--- filter/sort/navigate/preview, and allow to choose one or more items.
---
--- ## How to start a picker ~
---
--- - Use |MiniPick.start()| with `opts.source` defining |MiniPick-source|.
---   Example: `MiniPick.start({ source = { items = vim.fn.readdir('.') } })`
---
--- - Use any of |MiniPick.builtin| pickers directly.
---   Example: `MiniPick.builtin.files({ tool = 'git' })`
---
--- - Use |:Pick| command which uses customizable pickers from |MiniPick.registry|.
---   Example: `:Pick files tool='git'`
---
--- ## User interface ~
---
--- UI consists from a single window capable of displaying three different views:
--- - "Main" - where current query matches are shown.
--- - "Preview" - preview of current item (toggle with `<Tab>`).
--- - "Info" - general info about picker and its state (toggle with `<S-Tab>`).
---
--- Current prompt is displayed (in Neovim>=0.9) at the top left of the window
--- border with vertical line indicating caret (current input position).
---
--- Bottom part of window border displays (in Neovim>=0.10) extra visual feedback:
--- - Left part is a picker name.
--- - Right part contains information in the format >
---   <current index in matches> | <match count> | <marked count> / <total count>
---
--- When picker is busy (like if there are no items yet set or matching is active)
--- window border changes color to be `MiniPickBorderBusy` after `config.delay.busy`
--- milliseconds of idle time.
---
--- ## Life cycle ~
---
--- - Type characters to filter and sort matches. It uses |MiniPick.default_match()|
---   with `query` being an array of pressed characters.
---   Overview of how it matches:
---     - If query starts with `'`, the match is exact.
---     - If query starts with `^`, the match is exact at start.
---     - If query ends with `$`, the match is exact at end.
---     - If query starts with `*`, the match is forced to be fuzzy.
---     - Otherwise match is fuzzy.
---     - Sorting is done to first minimize match width and then match start.
---       Nothing more: no favoring certain places in string, etc.
---
--- - Type special keys to perform |MiniPick-actions|. Here are some basic ones:
---     - `<C-n>` / `<Down>` moves down; `<C-p>` / `<Up>` moves up.
---     - `<Left>` / `<Right>` moves prompt caret left / right.
---     - `<S-Tab>` toggles information window with all available mappings.
---     - `<Tab>` toggles preview.
---     - `<C-x>` / `<C-a>` toggles current / all item(s) as (un)marked.
---     - `<C-Space>` / `<M-Space>` makes all matches or marked items as new picker.
---     - `<CR>` / `<M-CR>` chooses current/marked item(s).
---     - `<Esc>` / `<C-c>` stops picker.
---
--- ## Implementation details ~
---
--- - Any picker is non-blocking but waits to return the chosen item. Example:
---   `file = MiniPick.builtin.files()` allows other actions to be executed when
---   picker is shown while still assigning `file` with value of the chosen item.
---@tag MiniPick-overview

--- Source is defined as a `source` field inside one of (in increasing priority):
--- - |MiniPick.config| - has global effect.
--- - |vim.b.minipick_config| - has buffer-local effect.
--- - `opts.source` in picker call - has effect for that particular call.
---
--- Example of source to choose from |arglist|: >
---   { items = vim.fn.argv, name = 'Arglist' }
--- <
---
--- Note: this is mostly useful for writing pickers. Can safely skip if you
--- want to just use provided pickers.
---
---                                                          *MiniPick-source.items*
--- # Items ~
---
--- `source.items` defines items to choose from. It should be one of the following:
--- - Array of objects which can have different types. Any type is allowed.
--- - `nil`. Picker waits for explicit |MiniPick.set_picker_items()| call.
--- - Callable returning any of the previous types. Will be called once on start.
---
---                                                 *MiniPick-source.items-stritems*
--- Matching is done for items array based on the string representation of its
--- elements (here called "stritems"). For single item it is computed as follows:
--- - Callable is called once with output used in next steps.
--- - String item is used as is.
--- - String <text> field of table item is used (if present).
--- - Use output of |vim.inspect()|.
---
--- Example: >
---
---   items = { 'aaa.txt', { text = 'bbb' }, function() return 'ccc' end }
---   -- corresponding stritems are { 'aaa.txt', 'bbb', 'ccc' }
---
--- Default value is `nil`, assuming it always be supplied by the caller.
---
---                                                   *MiniPick-source.items-common*
--- There are some recommendations for common item types in order for them to work
--- out of the box with |MiniPick.default_show()|, |MiniPick.default_preview()|,
--- |MiniPick.default_choose()|, |MiniPick.default_choose_marked()|:
---
--- - Path (file or directory). Use string or `path` field of a table. Path can
---   be either absolute or relative to the `source.cwd`.
---   Examples: `'aaa.txt'`, `{ path = 'aaa.txt' }`
---
--- - Buffer. Use buffer id as number, string, or `bufnr` / `buf_id` / `buf`
---   field of a table (any name is allowed).
---   Examples: `1`, `'1'`, `{ bufnr = 1 }`, `{ buf_id = 1 }`, `{ buf = 1 }`
---
--- - Line in file or buffer. Use table representation with `lnum` field with line
---   number (starting from 1). Files can use string in "<path>:<line>" format.
---   Examples: >
---   { path = 'aaa.txt', lnum = 2 }, 'aaa.txt:2', { path = 'aaa.txt:2' },
---   { bufnr = 1, lnum = 3 }
---
--- - Position in file or buffer. Use table representation with `lnum` and `col`
---   fields with line and column numbers (starting from 1). Files can use string
---   in "<path>:<line>:<col>" format.
---   Examples: >
---   { path = 'aaa.txt', lnum = 2, col = 3 }, 'aaa.txt:2:3',
---   { path = 'aaa.txt:2:3' }, { bufnr = 1, lnum = 3, col = 4 }
---
--- - Region in file or buffer. Use table representation with `lnum`, `col`,
---   `end_lnum`, `end_col` fields for start and end line/column. All numbers
---   start from 1, end line is inclusive, end column is exclusive.
---   This naming is similar to |getqflist()| and |diagnostic-structure|.
---   Examples: >
---   { path = 'aaa.txt', lnum = 2, col = 3, end_lnum = 4, end_col = 5 },
---   { bufnr = 1, lnum = 3, col = 4, end_lnum = 5, end_col = 6 }
---
--- Note: all table items will benefit from having `text` field for better matching.
---
---                                                           *MiniPick-source.name*
--- # Name ~
---
--- `source.name` defines the name of the picker to be used for visual feedback.
---
--- Default value is "<No name>".
---
---                                                            *MiniPick-source.cwd*
--- # Current working directory ~
---
--- `source.cwd` is a string defining the current working directory in which
--- picker operates. It should point to a valid actually present directory path.
--- This is a part of source to allow persistent way to use relative paths,
--- i.e. not depend on current directory being constant after picker start.
--- It also makes the |MiniPick.builtin.resume()| picker more robust.
---
--- Default value is |current-directory|.
---
---                                                          *MiniPick-source.match*
--- # Match ~
---
--- `source.match` is a callable defining how stritems
--- (see |MiniPick-source.items-stritems|) are matched (filetered and sorted) based
--- on the query.
---
--- It will be called with the following arguments:
--- - `stritems` - all available stritems for current picker.
--- - `inds` - array of `stritems` indexes usually pointing at current matches.
---   It does point to current matches in the case of interactively appending
---   character at the end of the query. It assumes that matches for such bigger
---   query is a subset of previous matches (implementation can ignore it).
---   This can be utilized to increase performance by checking fewer stritems.
--- - `query` - array of strings. Usually (like is common case of user interactively
---   typing query) each string represents one character. However, any strings are
---   allowed, as query can be set with |MiniPick.set_picker_query()|.
---
--- It should either return array of match indexes for stritems elements matching
--- the query (synchronous) or explicitly use |MiniPick.set_picker_match_inds()|
--- to set them (may be asynchronous).
---
--- Notes:
--- - The result can be any array of `stritems` indexes, i.e. not necessarily
---   a subset of input `inds`.
---
--- - Both `stritems` and `query` depend on values of 'ignorecase' and 'smartcase'.
---   If query shows "ignore case" properties (only 'ignorecase' is set or both
---   'ignorecase' / 'smartcase' are set and query has only lowercase characters),
---   then `stritems` and `query` will have only lowercase characters.
---   This allows automatic support for case insensitive matching while being
---   faster and having simpler match function implementation.
---
--- - Writing custom `source.match` usually means also changing |MiniPick-source.show|
---   because it is used to highlight stritems parts actually matching the query.
---
--- Example of simple "exact" `match()` preserving initial order: >
---
---   local match_exact = function(stritems, inds, query)
---     local prompt_pattern = vim.pesc(table.concat(query))
---     local f = function(i) return stritems[i]:find(prompt_pattern) ~= nil end
---     return vim.tbl_filter(f, inds)
---   end
--- <
---   For non-blocking version see |MiniPick.poke_is_picker_active()|.
---
--- Default value is |MiniPick.default_match()|.
---
---                                                           *MiniPick-source.show*
--- # Show ~
---
--- `source.show` is a callable defining how matched items are shown in the window.
---
--- It will be called with the following arguments:
--- - `buf_id` - identifier of the target buffer.
--- - `items_to_show` - array of actual items to be shown in `buf_id`. This is
---   a subset of currently matched items computed to fit in current window view.
--- - `query` - array of strings. Same as in `source.match`.
---
--- It should update buffer `buf_id` to visually represent `items_to_show`
--- __one item per line starting from line one__ (it shouldn't depend on
--- `options.content_from_bottom`). This also includes possible visualization
--- of which parts of stritem actually matched query.
---
--- Example (assuming string items; without highlighting): >
---
---   local show_prepend = function(buf_id, items_arr, query)
---     local lines = vim.tbl_map(function(x) return 'Item: ' .. x end, items_arr)
---     vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false, lines)
---   end
---
--- Default value is |MiniPick.default_show()|.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-source.preview*
--- # Preview ~
---
--- `source.preview` is a callable defining how item preview is done.
---
--- It will be called with the following arguments:
--- - `buf_id` - identifier of the target buffer. Note: for every separate instance
---   of item previewing new scratch buffer is be created.
--- - `item` - item to preview.
---
--- It should update buffer `buf_id` to visually represent `item`.
---
--- Example: >
---
---   local preview_inspect = function(buf_id, item)
---     local lines = vim.split(vim.inspect(item), '\n')
---     vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(buf_id, 0, -1, false, lines)
---   end
---
--- Default value is |MiniPick.default_preview()|.
---
---                                                         *MiniPick-source.choose*
--- # Choose an item ~
---
--- `source.choose` is a callable defining what to do when an item is chosen.
---
--- It will be called with the following arguments:
--- - `item` - chosen item. Always non-`nil`.
---
--- It should perform any intended "choose" action for an item and return
--- a value indicating whether picker should continue (i.e. not stop):
--- `nil` and `false` will stop picker, other values will continue.
---
--- Notes:
--- - It is called when picker window is still current. Use `windows.target` value
---   from |MiniPick.get_picker_state()| output to do something with target window.
---
--- Example: >
---
---   local choose_file_continue = function(item)
---     if vim.fn.filereadable(item) == 0 then return end
---     vim.api.nvim_win_call(
---       MiniPick.get_picker_state().windows.main,
---       function() vim.cmd('edit ' .. item) end
---     )
---     return true
---   end
---
--- Default value is |MiniPick.default_choose()|.
---
---                                                  *MiniPick-source.choose_marked*
--- # Choose marked items ~
---
--- `source.choose_marked` is a callable defining what to do when marked items
--- (see |MiniPick-actions-mark|) are chosen. Serves as a companion to
--- `source.choose` which can choose several items.
---
--- It will be called with the following arguments:
--- - `items_marked` - array of marked items. Can be empty.
---
--- It should perform any intended "choose" action for several items and return
--- a value indicating whether picker should continue (i.e. not stop):
--- `nil` and `false` will stop picker, other values will continue.
---
--- Notes:
--- - It is called when picker window is still current. Use `windows.target` value
---   from |MiniPick.get_picker_state()| output to do something with target window.
---
--- Example: >
---
---   local choose_marked_print = function(items) print(vim.inspect(items)) end
---
--- Default value is |MiniPick.default_choose_marked()|.
---@tag MiniPick-source

--- When picker is active, `mappings` table defines a set of special keys which when
--- pressed will execute certain actions. Those can be of two types:
--- - Built-in: actions present in default `config.mappings`. Can be only overridden
---   with a different key.
--- - Custom: user defined actions. Should be a table with `char` and `func` fields.
---
---
--- # Built-in ~
---                                                         *MiniPick-actions-caret*
--- ## Caret ~
---
--- User can add character not only at query end, but more generally at caret.
---
--- - `mappings.caret_left` - move caret to left.
--- - `mappings.caret_right` - move caret to right.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-choose*
--- ## Choose ~
---
--- Choose is a fundamental action that actually implements the intent of
--- calling a picker, i.e. pick an item.
---
--- - `mappings.choose` - choose as is, i.e. apply `source.choose` for current item.
--- - `mappings.choose_in_split` - make horizontal split at target window, update
---   target window to the new split, and choose.
--- - `mappings.choose_in_tabpage` - same as `choose_in_split`, but create tabpage.
--- - `mappings.choose_in_vsplit` - same as `choose_in_split`, but split vertically.
--- - `mappings.choose_marked` - choose marked items as is, i.e.
---   apply `source.choose_marked` at current marked items.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-delete*
--- ## Delete ~
---
--- Delete actions are for deleting elements from query.
---
--- - `mappings.delete_char` - delete one character to the left.
--- - `mappings.delete_char_right` - delete one character to the right.
--- - `mappings.delete_left` - delete everything to the left (like |i_CTRL-U|).
--- - `mappings.delete_word` - delete word to the left (like |i_CTRL-W|).
---
---                                                          *MiniPick-actions-mark*
--- ## Mark ~
---
--- Marking is an action of adding certain items to a separate list which then can
--- be chosen with `mappings.choose_marked` (for example, sent to quickfix list).
--- This is a companion to a regular choosing which can pick only one item.
---
--- - `mappings.mark` - toggle marked/unmarked state of current item.
--- - `mappings.mark_all` - toggle marked/unmarked state (mark all if not all
---   marked; unmark all otherwise) of all currently matched items.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Marks persist across queries and matches. For example, user can make a query
---   with marking all matches several times and marked items from all queries
---   will be preserved.
---
---                                                          *MiniPick-actions-move*
--- ## Move ~
---
--- Move is a fundamental action of changing which item is current.
---
--- - `mappings.move_down` - change focus to the item below.
--- - `mappings.move_start` change focus to the first currently matched item
--- - `mappings.move_up` - change focus to the item above.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Up and down wrap around edges: `move_down` on last item moves to first,
---   `move_up` on first moves to last.
--- - Moving when preview or info view is shown updates the view with new item.
--- - These also work with non-overridable alternatives:
---     - `<Down>` moves down.
---     - `<Home>` moves to first matched.
---     - `<Up>` moves up.
---
---                                                         *MiniPick-actions-paste*
--- ## Paste ~
---
--- Paste is an action to paste content of |registers| at caret.
---
--- - `mappings.paste` - paste from register defined by the next key press.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Does not support expression register `=`.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-refine*
--- ## Refine ~
---
--- Refine is an action that primarily executes the following:
--- - Takes certain items and makes them be all items (in order they are present).
--- - Resets query.
--- - Updates `source.match` to be the one from config.
---
--- - `mappings.refine` - refine currently matched items.
--- - `mappings.refin_marked` - refine currently marked items.
---
--- This action is useful in at least two cases:
--- - Perform consecutive "narrowing" queries. Example: to get items that contain
---   both "hello" and "world" exact matches (in no particular order) with default
---   matching, type "'hello" (notice "'" at the start) followed by `<C-Space>` and
---   another "'world".
--- - Reset `match` to default. Particularly useful in |MiniPick.builtin.grep_live()|.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-scroll*
--- ## Scroll ~
---
--- Scroll is an action to either move current item focus further than to the
--- neighbor item or adjust window view to see more information.
---
--- - `mappings.scroll_down` - when matches are shown, go down by the amount of
---   visible matches. In preview and info view - scroll down as with |CTRL-F|.
--- - `mappings.scroll_left` - scroll left as with |zH|.
--- - `mappings.scroll_right` - scroll right as with |zL|.
--- - `mappings.scroll_up` - when matches are shown, go up by the amount of
---   visible matches. In preview and info view - scroll up as with |CTRL-B|.
---
---                                                          *MiniPick-actions-stop*
--- ## Stop ~
---
--- `mappings.stop` stops the picker. <C-c> also always stops the picker.
---
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-toggle*
--- ## Toggle ~
---
--- Toggle action is a way to change view: show if target is not shown, reset to
--- main view otherwise.
---
--- - `mappings.toggle_info` - toggle info view.
--- - `mappings.toggle_preview` - toggle preview.
---
--- Note:
--- - Updating query in any way resets window view to show matches.
--- - Moving current item focus keeps preview or info view with updated item.
---
---                                                        *MiniPick-actions-custom*
--- # Custom ~
---
--- Along with built-in actions, users can define custom actions. This can be
--- done by supplying custom elements to `mappings` table. The field defines action
--- name (used to infer an action description in info view). The value is a table
--- with the following fields:
--- - <char> `(string)` - single character acting as action trigger.
--- - <func> `(function)` - callable to be executed without arguments after
---   user presses <char>.
---
--- Example of `execute` custom mapping: >
---
---   execute = {
---     char = '<C-e>',
---     func = function() vim.cmd(vim.fn.input('Execute: ')) end,
---   }
---@tag MiniPick-actions

--- Common configuration examples ~
---
--- - Disable icons in |MiniPick.builtin| pickers related to paths: >
---
---   local pick = require('mini.pick')
---   pick.setup({ source = { show = pick.default_show } })
---
--- - Mappings to switch `toggle_{preview,info}` and `move_{up,down}`: >
---
---   require('mini.pick').setup({
---     mappings = {
---       toggle_info    = '<C-k>',
---       toggle_preview = '<C-p>',
---       move_down      = '<Tab>',
---       move_up        = '<S-Tab>',
---     }
---   })

--- Calling this function creates a `:Pick` user command. It takes picker name
--- from |MiniPick.registry| as mandatory first argument and executes it with

--- To add custom pickers, update |MiniPick.registry|.
---

--- Module config
---
--- Default values:
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text # Delays ~
---
--- `config.delay` defines plugin delays (in ms). All should be strictly positive.
---
--- `delay.async` is a delay between forcing asynchronous behavior. This usually
--- means making screen redraws and utilizing |MiniPick.poke_is_picker_active()|
--- (for example, to stop current matching if query has updated).
--- Smaller values give smoother user experience at the cost of more computations.
---
--- `delay.busy` is a delay between when some computation starts and showing
--- visual feedback about it by making window border to have `MiniPickBorderBusy`
--- highlight group.
--- Smaller values will give feedback faster at the cost of feeling like flicker.
---
--- # Mappings ~
---
--- `config.mappings` defines keys for special actions to be triggered after certain
--- keys. See |MiniPick-actions| for more information.
---
--- # Options ~
---
--- `config.options` contains some general purpose options.
---
--- `options.content_from_bottom` is a boolean indicating whether content should be
--- shown from bottom to top. That means that best matches will be shown at
--- the bottom. Note: for better experience use Neovim>=0.10, which has floating
--- window footer capability. Default: `false`.
---
--- `options.use_cache` is a boolean indicating whether match results should be
--- cached per prompt (i.e. concatenated query). This results into faster response
--- on repeated prompts (like when deleting query entries) at the cost of using
--- more memory. Default: `false`.
---
--- # Source ~
---
--- `config.source` defines fallbacks for source specification. For example, this
--- can be used to change default `match` to use different implementation or `show`
--- to not show icons for some |MiniPick.builtin| pickers (see |MiniPick-examples|).
--- See |MiniPick-source| for more information.
---
--- # Window ~
---
--- `config.window` contains window specific configurations.
---
--- `window.config` defines a (parts of) default floating window config for the main
--- picker window. This can be either a table overriding some parts or a callable
--- returning such table. See |MiniPick-examples| for some examples.
---
--- `window.prompt_cursor` defines how cursor is displayed in window's prompt.
--- Default: '▏'.
---
--- `window.prompt_prefix` defines what prefix is used in window's prompt.
--- Default: '> '.

--- Default match
---
--- Filter target stritems to contain query and sort from best to worst matches.
---
--- Implements default value for |MiniPick-source.match|.
---
--- By default (if no special modes apply) it does the following fuzzy matching:
---
--- - Stritem contains query if it contains all its elements verbatim in the same
---   order (possibly with gaps, i.e. not strictly one after another).
---   Note: empty query and empty string element is contained in any string.
---
--- - Sorting is done with the following ordering (same as in |mini.fuzzy|):
---     - The smaller the match width (end column minus start column) the better.
---     - Among same match width, the smaller start column the better.
---     - Among same match width and start column, preserve original order.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Most common interactive usage results into `query` containing one typed
---   character per element.
---
--- # Special modes ~
---
--- - Forced modes:
---     - Query starts with "*": match the rest fuzzy (without other modes).
---     - Query starts with "'": match the rest exactly (without gaps).
---
--- - Place modes:
---     - Query starts with '^': match the rest exactly at start.
---     - Query ends with '$': match the rest exactly at end.
---     - Both modes can be used simultaneously.
---
--- - Grouped: query contains at least one whitespace element. Output is computed
---   as if query is split at whitespace indexes with concatenation between them.
---
--- Precedence of modes:
---   "forced exact" = "forced fuzzy" > "place start/end" > "grouped" > "default"
---
--- # Examples ~
---
--- Assuming `stritems` are `{ '_abc', 'a_bc', 'ab_c', 'abc_' }`, here are some
--- example matches based on prompt (concatenated query): >
---
---   | Prompt | Matches                |
---   |--------|------------------------|
---   | abc    | All                    |
---   | *abc   | All                    |
---   |        |                        |
---   | 'abc   | abc_, _abc             |
---   | *'abc  | None (no "'" in items) |
---   |        |                        |
---   | ^abc   | abc_                   |
---   | *^abc  | None (no "^" in items) |
---   |        |                        |
---   | abc$   | _abc                   |
---   | *abc$  | None (no "$" in items) |
---   |        |                        |
---   | ab c   | abc_, _abc, ab_c       |
---   | *ab c  | None (no " " in items) |
---
--- Having query `{ 'ab', 'c' }` is the same as "ab c" prompt.
---
--- You can have a feel of how this works with this command: >
---
---   MiniPick.start({ source = { items = { '_abc', 'a_bc', 'ab_c', 'abc_' } } })

---@param do_sync boolean|nil Whether to match synchronously. Default: `nil`.
---
---@return table|nil Depending on whether computation is synchronous (either `do_sync`
---   is truthy or there is an active picker):
---   - If yes, array of `stritems` indexes matching the `query` (from best to worst).
---   - If no, `nil` is returned with |MiniPick.set_picker_match_inds()| used later.
