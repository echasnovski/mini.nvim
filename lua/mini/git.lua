--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
---
--- - Automated tracking of Git related data: root path, status, HEAD, etc.
---   Exposes buffer-local variables for convenient use in statusline.
---   See |MiniGit.enable()| and |MiniGit.get_buf_data()| for more information.
---
--- - |:Git| command for executing any `git` call inside file's repository root with
---   deeper current instance integration (show output as notification/buffer,
---   use to edit commit messages, etc.).
---
--- - Helper functions to inspect Git history:
---     - |MiniGit.show_range_history()| shows how certain line range evolved.
---     - |MiniGit.show_diff_source()| shows file state as it was at diff entry.
---     - |MiniGit.show_at_cursor()| shows Git related data depending on context.
---
--- What it doesn't do:
---
--- - Replace fully featured Git client. Rule of thumb: if feature does not rely
---   on a state of current Neovim (opened buffers, etc.), it is out of scope.
---   For more functionality, use either |MiniDiff| or fully featured Git client.

---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.git').setup({})` (replace `{}` with
--- your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniGit` which you can use
--- for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniGit.*`).
---
--- See |MiniGit.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'tpope/vim-fugitive':
---     - Mostly a dedicated Git client, while this module is not (by design).
---     - Provides buffer-local Git data only through fixed statusline component,
---       while this module has richer data in the form of a Lua table.
---     - Both provide |:Git| command with 'vim-fugitive' treating some cases
---       extra specially (like `:Git blame`, etc.), while this module mostly
---       treats all cases the same. See |MiniGit-examples| for how they can be
---       manually customized.
---       Also this module provides slightly different (usually richer)
---       completion suggestions.
---
--- - 'NeogitOrg/neogit':
---     - Similar to 'tpope/vim-fugitive', but without `:Git` command.
---
--- - 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim':
---     - Provides buffer-local Git data with emphasis on granular diff status,
---       while this module is more oriented towards repository and file level
---       data (root, HEAD, file status, etc.). Use |MiniDiff| for diff tracking.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To prevent buffer(s) from being tracked, set `vim.g.minigit_disable` (globally)
--- or `vim.b.minigit_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of
--- different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules for
--- disabling module's functionality is left to user.
--- See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # Statusline component ~
---
--- Tracked buffer data can be used in statusline via `vim.b.minigit_summary_string`
--- buffer-local variable. It is expected to be used as is. To show another info,
--- tweak buffer-local variable directly inside `MiniGitUpdated` `User` event: >lua
---
---   -- Use only HEAD name as summary string
---   local format_summary = function(data)
---     -- Utilize buffer-local table summary
---     local summary = vim.b[data.buf].minigit_summary
---     vim.b[data.buf].minigit_summary_string = summary.head_name or ''
---   end
---
---   local au_opts = { pattern = 'MiniGitUpdated', callback = format_summary }
---   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', au_opts)
--- <
--- # Tweaking command output ~
---
--- Buffer output of |:Git| command can be tweaked inside autocommand for
--- `MiniGitCommandSplit` `User` event (see |MiniGit-command-events|).
--- For example, to make `:vertical Git blame -- %` align blame output with the
--- current window state, use the following code: >lua
---
---   local align_blame = function(au_data)
---     if au_data.data.git_subcommand ~= 'blame' then return end
---
---     -- Align blame output with source
---     local win_src = au_data.data.win_source
---     vim.wo.wrap = false
---     vim.fn.winrestview({ topline = vim.fn.line('w0', win_src) })
---     vim.api.nvim_win_set_cursor(0, { vim.fn.line('.', win_src), 0 })
---
---     -- Bind both windows so that they scroll together
---     vim.wo[win_src].scrollbind, vim.wo.scrollbind = true, true
---   end
---
---   local au_opts = { pattern = 'MiniGitCommandSplit', callback = align_blame }
---   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', au_opts)
--- <
--- # History navigation ~
---
--- Function |MiniGit.show_at_cursor()| is specifically exported to make Git
--- history navigation easier. Here are some different ways it can be used:
---
--- - Call inside buffer for already committed file to show the evolution of
---   the current line (or visually selected range) through history.
---   It is essentially a `:Git log HEAD` with proper `-L` flag.
---   This also works inside output of |MiniGit.show_diff_source()|.
---
--- - Call with cursor on commit hash to inspect that commit in full.
---   This is usually helpful in the output of `:Git log`.
---
--- - Call with cursor inside diff entry to inspect its file in the state how it
---   was at certain commit. By default it shows state after commit, unless cursor
---   is on the "deleted" line (i.e. line starting with "-") in which case
---   state before commit is shown.
---
--- This workflow can be made more interactive when used with mapping, like this: >lua
---
---   local rhs = '<Cmd>lua MiniGit.show_at_cursor()<CR>'
---   vim.keymap.set({ 'n', 'x' }, '<Leader>gs', rhs, { desc = 'Show at cursor' })
--- <
---@tag MiniGit-examples

--- The `:Git` user command runs `git` CLI call with extra integration for currently
--- opened Neovim process:
--- - Command is executed inside repository root of the currently active file
---   (or |current-directory| if file is not tracked by this module).
---
--- - Command output is shown either in dedicated buffer in window split or as
---   notification via |vim.notify()|. Which method is used depends on whether
---   particular Git subcommand is supposed to show data for user to inspect
---   (like `log`, `status`, etc.) or not (like `commit`, `push`, etc.). This is
---   determined automatically based on the data Git itself provides.
---   Split window is made current after command execution.
---
---   Use split-related |command-modifiers| (|:vertical|, |:horizontal|, or |:tab|)
---   to force output in a particular type of split. Default split direction is
---   controlled by `command.split` in |MiniGit.config|.
---
---   Use |:silent| command modifier to not show any output.
---
---   Errors and warnings are always shown as notifications.
---
---   See |MiniGit-examples| for the example of tweaking command output.
---
--- - Editor for tasks that require interactive user input (like `:Git commit` or
---   `:Git rebase --interactive`) is opened inside current session in a separate
---   split. Make modifications as in regular buffer, |:write| changes followed by
---   |:close| / |:quit| for Git CLI command to resume.
---
--- Examples of usage:
--- - `:Git log --oneline` - show compact log of current repository.
--- - `:vert Git blame -- %` - show latest commits per line in vertical split.
--- - `:Git help rebase` - show help page for `rebase` subcommand.
--- - `:Git -C <cwd> status` - execute `git status` inside |current-directory|.
---
--- There is also a context aware completion which can be invoked with `<Tab>`:
--- - If completed word starts with "-", options for the current Git subcommand
---   are shown. Like completion at `:Git log -` will suggest `-L`, `--oneline`, etc.
--- - If there is an explicit " -- " to the cursor's left, incremental path
---   suggestions will be shown.
--- - If there is no recognized Git subcommand yet, show list of subcommands.
---   Otherwise for some common subcommands list of its targets will be suggested:
---   like for `:Git branch` it will be list of branches, etc.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Paths are always treated as relative to command's execution directory
---   (file's repository root or |current-directory| if absent).
--- - Don't use quotes for entries containing space, escape it with `\` directly.
---   Like `:Git commit -m Hello\ world` and not `:Git commit -m 'Hello world'`
---   (which treats `'Hello` and `world'` as separate arguments).
---
---                                                         *MiniGit-command-events*
--- There are several `User` events triggered during command execution:
---
--- - `MiniGitCommandDone` - after command is done executing. For Lua callbacks it
---   provides a special `data` table with the following fields:
---     - <cmd_input> `(table)` - structured data about executed command.
---       Has same structure as Lua function input in |nvim_create_user_command()|.
---     - <cwd> `(string)` - directory path inside which Git command was executed.
---     - `<exit_code>` `(number)` - exit code of CLI process.
---     - `<git_command>` `(table)` - array with arguments of full executed command.
---     - `<git_subcommand>` `(string)` - detected Git subcommand (like "log", etc.).
---     - `<stderr>` `(string)` - `stderr` process output.
---     - `<stdout>` `(string)` - `stdout` process output.
---
--- - `MiniGitCommandSplit` - after command showed its output in a split. Triggered
---   after `MiniGitCommandDone` and provides similar `data` table with extra fields:
---     - `<win_source>` `(number)` - window identifier of "source" window (current at
---       the moment before command execution).
---     - `<win_stdout>` `(number)` - window identifier of command output.
---@tag MiniGit-command
---@tag :Git

---@alias __git_buf_id number Target buffer identifier. Default: 0 for current buffer.
---@alias __git_split_field <split> `(string)` - split direction. One of "horizontal", "vertical",
---     "tab", or "auto" (default). Value "auto" uses |:vertical| if only 'mini.git'
---     buffers are shown in the tabpage and |:tab| otherwise.

--- Fold expression for Git logs
---
--- Folds contents of hunks, file patches, and log entries in unified diff.
--- Useful for filetypes "diff" (like after `:Git diff`) and "git" (like after

--- Works well with |MiniGit.show_range_history()|.
---
--- General idea of folding levels (use |zr| and |zm| to adjust interactively):
--- - At level 0 there is one line per whole patch or log entry.
--- - At level 1 there is one line per patched file.
--- - At level 2 there is one line per hunk.
--- - At level 3 there is no folds.
---
--- For automated setup, set the following for "git" and "diff" filetypes (either
--- inside |FileType| autocommand or |ftplugin|): >vim
---
---   setlocal foldmethod=expr foldexpr=v:lua.MiniGit.diff_foldexpr()
--- <

--- Enable Git tracking in a file buffer
---
--- Tracking is done by reacting to changes in file content or file's repository
--- in the form of keeping buffer data up to date. The data can be used via:
--- - |MiniGit.get_buf_data()|. See its help for a list of actually tracked data.
--- - `vim.b.minigit_summary` (table) and `vim.b.minigit_summary_string` (string)
---   buffer-local variables which are more suitable for statusline.
---   `vim.b.minigit_summary_string` contains information about HEAD, file status,
---   and in progress action (see |MiniGit.get_buf_data()| for more details).
---   See |MiniGit-examples| for how it can be tweaked and used in statusline.
---
--- Note: this function is called automatically for all new normal buffers.
--- Use it explicitly if buffer was disabled.
---
--- `User` event `MiniGitUpdated` is triggered whenever tracking data is updated.
--- Note that not all data listed in |MiniGit.get_buf_data()| can be present (yet)
