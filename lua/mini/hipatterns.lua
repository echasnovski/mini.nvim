---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Highlight text with configurable patterns and highlight groups (can be
---   string or callable).
---
--- - Highlighting is updated asynchronously with configurable debounce delay.
---
--- - Function to get matches in a buffer (see |MiniHipatterns.get_matches()|).
---
--- See |MiniHipatterns-examples| for common configuration examples.
---
--- Notes:
--- - It does not define any highlighters by default. Add to `config.highlighters`
---   to have a visible effect.
---
--- - Sometimes (especially during frequent buffer updates on same line numbers)
---   highlighting can be outdated or not applied when it should be. This is due
---   to asynchronous nature of updates reacting to text changes (via
---   `on_lines` of |nvim_buf_attach()|).
---   To make them up to date, use one of the following:
---     - Scroll window (for example, with |CTRL-E| / |CTRL-Y|). This will ensure
---       up to date highlighting inside window view.
---     - Hide and show buffer.
---     - Execute `:edit` (if you enabled highlighting with |MiniHipatterns.setup()|).
---     - Manually call |MiniHipatterns.update()|.
---
--- - If you experience flicker when typing near highlighted pattern in Insert
---   mode, it might be due to `delay` configuration of 'mini.completion' or
---   using built-in completion.
---   For better experience with 'mini.completion', make sure that its
---   `delay.completion` is less than this module's `delay.text_change` (which
---   it is by default).
---   The reason for this is (currently unresolvable) limitations of Neovim's
---   built-in completion implementation.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- Setting up highlights can be done in two ways:
--- - Manually for every buffer with `require('mini.hipatterns').enable()`.
---   This will enable highlighting only in one particular buffer until it is
---   unloaded (which also includes calling `:edit` on current file).
---
--- - Globally with `require('mini.hipatterns').setup({})` (replace `{}` with
---   your `config` table). This will auto-enable highlighting in "normal"
---   buffers (see 'buftype'). Use |MiniHipatterns.enable()| to manually enable
---   in other buffers.
---   It will also create global Lua table `MiniHipatterns` which you can use
---   for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniHipatterns.*`).
---
--- See |MiniHipatterns.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like highlighters and delays)
--- locally to buffer inside `vim.b.minihipatterns_config` which should have
--- same structure as `MiniHipatterns.config`.
--- See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'folke/todo-comments':
---     - Oriented for "TODO", "NOTE", "FIXME" like patterns, while this module
---       can work with any Lua patterns and computable highlight groups.
---     - Has functionality beyond text highlighting (sign placing,
---       "telescope.nvim" extension, etc.), while this module only focuses on
---       highlighting text.
--- - 'folke/paint.nvim':
---     - Mostly similar to this module, but with slightly less functionality,
---       such as computed pattern and highlight group, asynchronous delay, etc.
--- - 'NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua':
---     - Oriented for color highlighting, while this module can work with any
---       Lua patterns and computable highlight groups.
---     - Has more built-in color spaces to highlight, while this module out of
---       the box provides only hex color highlighting
---       (see |MiniHipatterns.gen_highlighter.hex_color()|). Other types are
---       also possible to implement.
--- - 'uga-rosa/ccc.nvim':
---     - Has more than color highlighting functionality, which is compared to
---       this module in the same way as 'NvChad/nvim-colorizer.lua'.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniHipatternsFixme` - suggested group to use for `FIXME`-like patterns.
--- * `MiniHipatternsHack` - suggested group to use for `HACK`-like patterns.
--- * `MiniHipatternsTodo` - suggested group to use for `TODO`-like patterns.
--- * `MiniHipatternsNote` - suggested group to use for `NOTE`-like patterns.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- This module can be disabled in three ways:
--- - Globally: set `vim.g.minihipatterns_disable` to `true`.
--- - Locally for buffer permanently: set `vim.b.minihipatterns_disable` to `true`.
--- - Locally for buffer temporarily (until next auto-enabling event if set up
---   with |MiniHipatterns.setup()|): call |MiniHipatterns.disable()|.
---
--- Considering high number of different scenarios and customization
--- intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's functionality is
--- left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # Common configuration examples ~
---
--- - Special words used to convey different level of attention: >
---
---   require('mini.hipatterns').setup({
---     highlighters = {
---       fixme = { pattern = 'FIXME', group = 'MiniHipatternsFixme' },
---       hack  = { pattern = 'HACK',  group = 'MiniHipatternsHack'  },
---       todo  = { pattern = 'TODO',  group = 'MiniHipatternsTodo'  },
---       note  = { pattern = 'NOTE',  group = 'MiniHipatternsNote'  },
---     }
---   })
--- <
--- - To match only when pattern appears as a standalone word, use frontier
---   patterns `%f`. For example, instead of `'TODO'` pattern use
---   `'%f[%w]()TODO()%f[%W]'`. In this case, for example, 'TODOING' or 'MYTODO'
---   won't match, but 'TODO' and 'TODO:' will.
---
--- - Color hex (like `#rrggbb`) highlighting: >
---
---   local hipatterns = require('mini.hipatterns')
---   hipatterns.setup({
---     highlighters = {
---       hex_color = hipatterns.gen_highlighter.hex_color(),
---     }
---   })
--- <
---   You can customize which part of hex color is highlighted by using `style`
---   field of input options. See |MiniHipatterns.gen_highlighter.hex_color()|.
---
--- - Colored words: >
---
---   local words = { red = '#ff0000', green = '#00ff00', blue = '#0000ff' }
---   local word_color_group = function(_, match)
---     local hex = words[match]
---     if hex == nil then return nil end
---     return MiniHipatterns.compute_hex_color_group(hex, 'bg')
---   end
---
---   local hipatterns = require('mini.hipatterns')
---   hipatterns.setup({
---     highlighters = {
---       word_color = { pattern = '%S+', group = word_color_group },
---     },
---   })
---
--- - Trailing whitespace (if don't want to use more specific 'mini.trailspace'): >
---
---   { pattern = '%f[%s]%s*$', group = 'Error' }
---
--- - Censor certain sensitive information: >
---
---   local censor_extmark_opts = function(_, match, _)
---     local mask = string.rep('x', vim.fn.strchars(match))
---     return {
---       virt_text = { { mask, 'Comment' } }, virt_text_pos = 'overlay',
---       priority = 200, right_gravity = false,
---     }
---   end
---
---   require('mini.hipatterns').setup({
---     highlighters = {
---       censor = {
---         pattern = 'password: ()%S+()',
---         group = '',
---         extmark_opts = censor_extmark_opts,
---       },
---     },
---   })
---
--- - Enable only in certain filetypes. There are at least these ways to do it:
---     - (Suggested) With `vim.b.minihipatterns_config` in |filetype-plugin|.
---       Basically, create "after/ftplugin/<filetype>.lua" file in your config
---       directory (see |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME|) and define `vim.b.minihipatterns_config`
---       there with filetype specific highlighters.
---
---       This assumes `require('mini.hipatterns').setup()` call.
---
---       For example, to highlight keywords in EmmyLua comments in Lua files,
---       create "after/ftplugin/lua.lua" with the following content: >
---
---         vim.b.minihipatterns_config = {
---           highlighters = {
---             emmylua = { pattern = '^%s*%-%-%-()@%w+()', group = 'Special' }
---           }
---         }
--- <
---     - Use callable `pattern` with condition. For example: >
---
---       require('mini.hipatterns').setup({
---         highlighters = {
---           emmylua = {
---             pattern = function(buf_id)
---               if vim.bo[buf_id].filetype ~= 'lua' then return nil end
---               return '^%s*%-%-%-()@%w+()'
---             end,
---             group = 'Special',
---           },
---         },
---       })
--- <
--- - Disable only in certain filetypes. Enable with |MiniHipatterns.setup()|
---   and set `vim.b.minihipatterns_disable` buffer-local variable to `true` for
---   buffer you want disabled. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for more examples.

---
--- ## Highlighters ~
---
--- `highlighters` table defines which patterns will be highlighted by placing
--- |extmark| at the match start. It might or might not have explicitly named
--- fields, but having them is recommended and is required for proper use of
--- `vim.b.minihipatterns_config` as buffer-local config. By default it is
--- empty expecting user definition.
---
--- Each entry defines single highlighter as a table with the following fields:
--- - <pattern> `(string|function|table)` - Lua pattern to highlight. Can be
---   either string, callable returning the string, or an array of those.
---   If string:
---     - It can have submatch delimited by placing `()` on start and end, NOT
---       by surrounding with it. Otherwise it will result in error containing
---       `number expected, got string`. Example: `xx()abcd()xx` will match `abcd`
---       only if `xx` is placed before and after it.
---
---   If callable:
---     - It will be called for every enabled buffer with its identifier as input.
---
---     - It can return `nil` meaning this particular highlighter will not work
---       in this particular buffer.
---
---   If array:
---     - Each element is matched and highlighted with the same highlight group.
---
--- - <group> `(string|function)` - name of highlight group to use. Can be either
---   string or callable returning the string.
---   If callable:
---     - It will be called for every pattern match with the following arguments:
---         - `buf_id` - buffer identifier.
---         - `match` - string pattern match to be highlighted.
---         - `data` - extra table with information about the match.
---           It has at least these fields:
---             - <full_match> - string with full pattern match.
---             - <line> - match line number (1-indexed).
---             - <from_col> - match starting byte column (1-indexed).
---             - <to_col> - match ending byte column (1-indexed, inclusive).
---
---     - It can return `nil` meaning this particular match will not be highlighted.
---
--- - <extmark_opts> `(table|function|nil)` - optional extra options
---   for |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|. If callable, will be called in the same way
---   as callable <group> (`data` will also contain `hl_group` key with <group>
---   value) and should return a table with all options for extmark (including
---   `end_row`, `end_col`, `hl_group`, and `priority`).
---   Note: if <extmark_opts> is supplied, <priority> is ignored.
---
--- - <priority> `(number|nil)` - SOFT DEPRECATED in favor
---   of `extmark_opts = { priority = <value> }`.
---   Optional highlighting priority (as in |nvim_buf_set_extmark()|).
---   Default: 200. See also |vim.highlight.priorities|.
---
--- See "Common use cases" section for the examples.
---
--- ## Delay ~
---
--- `delay` is a table defining delays in milliseconds used for asynchronous
--- highlighting process.
---
--- `delay.text_change` is used to delay highlighting updates by accumulating
--- them (in debounce fashion). Smaller values will lead to faster response but
--- more frequent updates. Bigger - slower response but less frequent updates.
---
--- `delay.scroll` is used to delay updating highlights in current window view
--- during scrolling (see |WinScrolled| event). These updates are present to
--- ensure up to date highlighting after scroll.
MiniHipatterns.config = {
  -- Table with highlighters (see |MiniHipatterns.config| for more details).
  -- Nothing is defined by default. Add manually for visible effect.
  highlighters = {},

  -- Delays (in ms) defining asynchronous highlighting process
  delay = {
    -- How much to wait for update after every text change
    text_change = 200,

    -- How much to wait for update after window scroll
    scroll = 50,
  },
}
--minidoc_afterlines_end

--- Enable highlighting in buffer
---
--- Notes:
--- - With default config it will highlight nothing, as there are no default
---   highlighters.
---
--- - Buffer highlighting is enabled until buffer is unloaded from memory
---   or |MiniHipatterns.disable()| on this buffer is called.
---
--- - `:edit` disables this, as it is mostly equivalent to closing and opening
---   buffer. In order for highlighting to persist after `:edit`, call
---   |MiniHipatterns.setup()|.
---
---@param buf_id __hipatterns_buf_id
---@param config table|nil Optional buffer-local config. Should have the same
---   structure as |MiniHipatterns.config|. Values will be taken in this order:
---   - From this `config` argument (if supplied).
---   - From buffer-local config in `vim.b.minihipatterns_config` (if present).
---   - From global config (if |MiniHipatterns.setup()| was called).
---   - From default values.
