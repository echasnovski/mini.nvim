---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Required to set two base colors: background and foreground.
---   Their shades and other non-base colors are computed to be as much
---   perceptually different as reasonably possible.
---   See |MiniHues.config| for setup inspiration.
---
--- - Configurable:
---     - Number of hues used for non-base colors (from 0 to 8).
---     - Saturation level ('low', 'medium', 'high').
---     - Accent color used for some selected UI elements.
---     - Plugin integration (can be selectively enabled for faster startup).
---
--- - Random generator for base colors. See |MiniHues.gen_random_base_colors()|.
---   Powers |randomhue| color scheme.
---
--- - Lua function to compute palette used in color scheme.
---   See |MiniHues.make_palette()|.
---
--- Supported highlight groups:
--- - All built-in UI and syntax groups.
---
--- - Built-in Neovim LSP and diagnostic.
---
--- - Tree-sitter (|treesitter-highlight-groups|).
---
--- - LSP semantic tokens (|lsp-semantic-highlight|).
---
--- - Plugins (either with explicit definition or by verification that default
---   highlighting works appropriately):
---     - 'echasnovski/mini.nvim'

--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.hues').setup({})` and
--- **mandatory `background` and `foreground` fields** (add more fields to fit
--- your taste). It will create global Lua table `MiniHues` which you can use
--- for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniHues.*`).
---
--- See |MiniHues.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- This module doesn't have runtime options, so using `vim.b.minihues_config`
--- will have no effect here.
---
--- Example:
--- >
---   require('mini.hues').setup({
---     background = '#11262d',
---     foreground = '#c0c8cc',
---     plugins = {
---       default = false,
---       ['echasnovski/mini.nvim'] = true,
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- # Notes ~
---
--- - Using `setup()` doesn't actually create a |colorscheme|. It basically
---   creates a coordinated set of |highlight|s. To create your own scheme:
---     - Put "myscheme.lua" file (name after your chosen theme name) inside
---       any "colors" directory reachable from 'runtimepath' ("colors" inside
---       your Neovim config directory is usually enough).
---     - Inside "myscheme.lua" call `require('mini.hues').setup()` with your
---       palette and only after that set |g:colors_name| to "myscheme".
---
--- - This module doesn't define |cterm-colors| for implementation simplicity.
---   Use |mini.colors| module, |MiniColors-colorscheme:add_cterm_attributes()|
---   in particular.

--- Random hue color scheme ~
---
--- This module comes with a pre-built color scheme but with a twist: every
--- `:colorscheme randomhue` call will result in a different (randomly yet
--- carefully selected) colors.
---
--- It is essentially a combination of calls to |MiniHues.setup()| and
--- |MiniHues.gen_random_base_colors()| with a slight adjustments for
--- 'background' value.
---
--- Activate it as regular |colorscheme|. Get currently active config with
--- `:lua print(vim.inspect(MiniHues.config))`.

--- Module setup
---
---@usage
--- `require('mini.hues').setup({ background = '#11262d', foreground = '#c0c8cc' })`
--- (add/change input table as you like)
MiniHues.setup = function(config)

--- Module config
---
--- See |MiniHues.make_palette()| for more information about how certain
--- settings affect output color scheme.
---
--- Default values:

---@text # Options ~
---
--- ## Plugin integrations ~
---
--- `config.plugins` defines for which supported plugins highlight groups will
--- be created. Limiting number of integrations slightly decreases startup time.
--- It is a table with boolean (`true`/`false`) values which are applied as follows:
--- - If plugin name (as listed in |mini.hues|) has entry, it is used.
--- - Otherwise `config.plugins.default` is used.
---
--- Example which will load only "mini.nvim" integration:
--- >
---   require('mini.hues').setup({
---     background = '#11262d',
---     foreground = '#c0c8cc',
---     plugins = {
---       default = false,
---       ['echasnovski/mini.nvim'] = true,
---     },
---   })
---
--- # Examples ~
---
--- Here are some possible setup configurations (copy first line and then use
--- only one `setup` call): >

--- Make palette
---
--- General idea of palette generation is that it is mostly based on color channel
--- information extracted from base colors (background and foreground).
---
--- All operations are done inside `Oklch` color space, meaning that each color
--- is defined by three numbers:
--- - Lightness (`l`) - number between 0 (black) and 100 (white) describing how
---   light is a color.
--- - Chroma (`c`) - positive number describing how colorful is a color (bigger
---   values - more colorful; 0 is gray).
--- - Hue (`h`) - periodic number in [0, 360) describing a value of "true color"
---   on color circle/wheel.
---
--- For more details about `Oklch` see |MiniColors-color-spaces| or
--- https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/.
---
--- Algorithm overview ~
---
--- - Extract lightness, chroma, and hue of base colors.
---
--- - Generate reference lightness values:
---     - Background edge: 0 or 100, whichever is closest to background lightness.
---     - Foreground edge: 0 or 100, different from background edge.
---     - Middle: arithmetic mean of background and foreground lightness values.
---
--- - Compute background and foreground tints and shades by changing lightness
---   of background color: two colors closer to background lightness edge and
---   two closer to middle.
---
--- - Pick chroma value for non-base colors based on `config.saturation`.
---
--- - Generate hues for non-base colors:
---     - Fit an equidistant circular grid with `config.n_hues` points to be as
---       far from both background and foreground hues. This will ensure that
---       non-base colors are as different as possible from base ones (for
---       better visual perception).
---       Example: for background hue 0, foreground hue 180, and `config.n_hues` 2
---       the output grid will be `{ 90, 270 }`.
---
---     - For each hue of reference color (which itself is an equidistant grid
---       of 8 hues) compute the closest value from the grid. This allows
---       operating in same terms (like "red", "green") despite maybe actually
---       having less different hues.
---
--- - Compute for each hue two variants of non-base colors: with background and
---   foreground lightness values.
---
--- - Compute two variants of accent color (with background and foreground
---   lightness) based on `config.accent`.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Some output colors can have not exact values of generated Oklch channels.
---   This is due to actually computed colors being impossible to represent via
---   '#rrggbb' hex string. In this case a process called gamut clipping is done
---   to reduce lightness and chroma in optimal way while maintaining same hue.
---   For more information see |MiniColors-gamut-clip|.
---
--- - Not all colors are actually used in highlight groups and are present for the
---   sake of completeness.
---
---@param config table Configuration for palette. Same structure as |MiniHues.config|.
---   Needs to have <background> and <foreground> fields.
---
---@return table Palette with the following fields:
---   - <bg> and <fg> with supplied `background` and `foreground` colors.
---   - Fields like <bg_*> and <fg_*> are essentially <bg> and <fg> but with
---     different lightness values: `_edge`/`_edge2` - closer to edge lightness,
---     `_mid`/`_mid2` - closer to middle lightness.
---   - Fields for non-base colors (<red>, <orange>, <yellow>, <green>, <cyan>,
---     <azure>, <blue>, <purple>) have the same lightness as foreground.
---   - Fields for non-base colors with <_bg> suffix have the same lightness as
---     background.
---   - <accent> and <accent_bg> represent accent colors with foreground and
---     background lightness values.
