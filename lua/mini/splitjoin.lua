--- *mini.splitjoin* Split and join arguments
--- *MiniSplitjoin*

--- MIT License Copyright (c) 2023 Evgeni Chasnovski
---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Mappings and Lua functions that modify arguments (regions inside brackets
---   between allowed separators) under cursor.
---
---   Supported actions:
---     - Toggle - split if arguments are on single line, join otherwise.
---       Main supported function of the module. See |MiniSplitjoin.toggle()|.
---     - Split - make every argument separator be on end of separate line.
---       See |MiniSplitjoin.split()|.
---     - Join - make all arguments be on single line.
---       See |MiniSplitjoin.join()|.
---
--- - Mappings are dot-repeatable in Normal mode and work in Visual mode.
---
--- - Customizable argument detection (see |MiniSplitjoin.config.detect|):
---     - Which brackets can contain arguments.
---     - Which strings can separate arguments.
---     - Which regions are excluded when looking for separators (like inside
---       nested brackets or quotes).
---
--- - Customizable pre and post hooks for both split and join. See `split` and
---   `join` in |MiniSplitjoin.config|. There are several built-in ones
---   in |MiniSplitjoin.gen_hook|.
---
--- - Works inside comments by using modified notion of indent.
---   See |MiniSplitjoin.get_indent_part()|.
---
--- - Provides low-level Lua functions for split and join at positions.
---   See |MiniSplitjoin.split_at()| and |MiniSplitjoin.join_at()|.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Search for arguments is done using Lua patterns (regex-like approach).
---   Certain amount of false positives is to be expected.
---
--- - This module is mostly designed around |MiniSplitjoin.toggle()|. If target
---   split positions are on different lines, join first and then split.
---
--- - Actions can be done on Visual mode selection, which mostly present as
---   a safety route in case of incorrect detection of initial region.
---   It uses |MiniSplitjoin.get_visual_region()| which treats selection as full
---   brackets (include brackets in selection).
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.splitjoin').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniSplitjoin`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniSplitjoin.*`).
---
--- See |MiniSplitjoin.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like action hooks) locally to
--- buffer inside `vim.b.minisplitjoin_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniSplitjoin.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'FooSoft/vim-argwrap':
---     - Mostly has the same design as this module.
---     - Doesn't work inside comments, while this module does.
---     - Has more built-in ways to control split and join, while this module
---       intentionally provides only handful.
--- - 'AndrewRadev/splitjoin.vim':
---     - More oriented towards language-depended transformations, while this
---       module intntionally deals with more generic text-related functionality.
--- - 'Wansmer/treesj':
---     - Operates based on tree-sitter nodes. This is more accurate in
---       some edge cases, but **requires** tree-sitter parser.
---     - Doesn't work inside comments or strings.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `g:minisplitjoin_disable` (globally) or `b:minisplitjoin_disable`
--- (for a buffer) to `v:true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
--- and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
--- recipes.

--- - POSITION - table with fields <line> and <col> containing line and column
---   numbers respectively. Both are 1-indexed. Example: `{ line = 2, col = 1 }`.
---
--- - REGION - table representing region in a buffer. Fields: <from> and
---   <to> for inclusive start and end positions. Example: >
---
---   { from = { line = 1, col = 1 }, to = { line = 2, col = 1 } }
---@tag MiniSplitjoin-glossary

---@alias __splitjoin_options table|nil Options. Has structure from |MiniSplitjoin.config|
---   inheriting its default values.
---
---   Following extra optional fields are allowed:
---   - <position> `(table)` - position at which to find smallest bracket region.
---     See |MiniSplitjoin-glossary| for the structure.
---     Default: cursor position.
---   - <region> `(table)` - region at which to perform action. Assumes inclusive
---     both start at left bracket and end at right bracket.
---     See |MiniSplitjoin-glossary| for the structure.
---     Default: `nil` to automatically detect region.
---@alias __splitjoin_hook_brackets - <brackets> `(table)` - array of bracket patterns indicating on which
---      brackets action should be made. Has same structure as `brackets`
---      in |MiniSplitjoin.config.detect|.
---      Default: `MiniSplitjoin.config.detect.brackets`.

--- Module config
---
--- Default values:
---@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)
---@text                                                    *MiniSplitjoin.config.detect*
--- # Detection ~
---
--- The table at `config.detect` controls how arguments are detected using Lua
--- patterns. General idea is to convert whole buffer into a single line,
--- perform string search, and convert results back into 2d positions.
---
--- Example configuration: >
---
---   require('mini.splitjoin').setup({
---     detect = {
---       -- Detect only inside balanced parenthesis
---       brackets = { '%b()' },
---
---       -- Allow both `,` and `;` to separate arguments
---       separator = '[,;]',
---
---       -- Make any separator define an argument
---       exclude_regions = {},
---     },
---   })
---
--- ## Outer brackets ~
---
--- `detect.brackets` is an array of Lua patterns used to find enclosing region.
--- It is done by traversing whole buffer to find the smallest region matching
--- any supplied pattern.
---
--- Default: `nil`, inferred as `{ '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }`.
--- So an argument can be inside a balanced `()`, `[]`, or `{}`.
---
--- Example: `brackets = { '%b()' }` will search for arguments only inside
--- balanced `()`.
---
--- ## Separator ~
---
--- `detect.separator` is a single Lua pattern defining which strings should be
--- treated as argument separators.
---
--- Empty string in `detect.separator` will result in only surrounding brackets
--- used as separators.
---
--- Only end of pattern match will be used as split/join positions.
---
--- Default: `','`. So an argument can be separated only with comma.
---
--- Example: `separator = { '[,;]' }` will treat both `,` and `;` as separators.
---
--- ## Excluded regions ~
---
--- `detect.exclude_regions` is an array of Lua patterns for sub-regions from which
--- to exclude separators. Enables correct detection in case of nested brackets
--- and quotes.
---
--- Default: `nil`; inferred as `{ '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}', '%b""', "%b''" }`.
--- So a separator **can not** be inside a balanced `()`, `[]`, `{}` (representing
--- nested argument regions) or `""`, `''` (representing strings).
---
--- Example: `exclude_regions = {}` will not exclude any regions. So in case of
--- `f(a, { b, c })` it will detect both commas as argument separators.
---
--- # Hooks ~
---
--- `split.hooks_pre`, `split.hooks_post`, `join.hooks_pre`, and `join.hooks_post`
--- are arrays of hook functions. If empty (default) no hook is applied.
---
--- Hooks should take and return array of positions. See |MiniSplitjoin-glossary|.
---
--- They can be used to tweak actions:
---
--- - Pre-hooks are called before action. Each is applied on the output of
---   previous one. Input of first hook are detected split/join positions.
---   Output of last one is actually used to perform split/join.
---
--- - Post-hooks are called after action. Each is applied on the output of
---   previous one. Input of first hook are split/join positions from actual
---   action plus its region's right end as last position (for easier hook code).
---   Output of last one is used as action return value.
---
--- For more specific details see |MiniSplitjoin.split()| and |MiniSplitjoin.join()|.
---
--- See |MiniSplitjoin.gen_hook| for generating common hooks with examples.

--- Split arguments
---
--- Overview:
--- - Detect region: either by using supplied `opts.region` or by finding smallest
---   bracketed region surrounding input position (cursor position by default).
---   See |MiniSplitjoin.config.detect| for more details.
---
--- - Find separator positions using `separator` and `exclude_regions` from `opts`.
---   Both brackets are treated as separators.
---   See |MiniSplitjoin.config.detect| for more details.
---   Note: stop if no separator positions are found.
---
--- - Modify separator positions to represent split positions. Last split position
---   (which is inferred from right bracket) is moved one column to left so that
---   right bracket would move on new line.
---
--- - Apply all hooks from `opts.split.hooks_pre`. Each is applied on the output of
---   previous one. Input of first hook is split positions from previous step.
---   Output of last one is used as split positions in next step.
---
--- - Split and update split positions with |MiniSplitjoin.split_at()|.
---
--- - Apply all hooks from `opts.split.hooks_post`. Each is applied on the output of
---   previous one. Input of first hook is split positions from previous step plus
---   region's right end (for easier hook code).
---   Output of last one is used as function return value.
---
--- Note:
--- - By design, it doesn't detect if argument **should** be split, so application
---   on arguments spanning multiple lines can lead to undesirable result.
---
---@param opts __splitjoin_options
---
---@return any Output of last `opts.split.hooks_post` or `nil` if no split positions
---   found. Default: return value of |MiniSplitjoin.split_at()| application.

--- Join at positions
---

--- - Use output of this function to keep track of input positions.
---
---@param positions table Array of positions at which to perform join.
---   See |MiniSplitjoin-glossary| for their structure. Note: they don't have
