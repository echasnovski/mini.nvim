--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Snippet is a template for a frequently used text. Typical workflow is to type
--- snippet's (configurable) prefix and expand it into a snippet session.
---
--- The template usually contains both pre-defined text and places (called
--- "tabstops") for user to interactively change/add text during snippet session.
---
--- This module supports (only) snippet syntax defined in LSP specification (with
--- small deviations). See |MiniSnippets-syntax-specification|.
---
--- Features:
--- - Manage snippet collection by adding it explicitly or with a flexible set of
---   performant built-in loaders. See |MiniSnippets.gen_loader|.
---
--- - Configured snippets are efficiently resolved before every expand based on
---   current local context. This, for example, allows using different snippets
---   in different local tree-sitter languages (like in markdown code blocks).
---   See |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()|.
---
--- - Match which snippet to insert based on the currently typed text.
---   Supports both exact and fuzzy matching. See |MiniSnippets.default_match()|.
---
--- - Select from several matched snippets via `vim.ui.select()`.
---   See |MiniSnippets.default_select()|.
---
--- - Start specialized in-process LSP server to show loaded snippets inside
---   (auto)completion engines (like |mini.completion|).
---   See |MiniSnippets.start_lsp_server()|.
---
--- - Insert, jump, and edit during snippet session in a configurable manner:
---     - Configurable mappings for jumping and stopping.
---     - Jumping wraps around the tabstops for easier navigation.
---     - Easy to reason rules for when session automatically stops.
---     - Text synchronization of linked tabstops preserving relative indent.
---     - Dynamic tabstop state visualization (current/visited/unvisited, etc.)
---     - Inline visualization of empty tabstops (requires Neovim>=0.10).
---     - Works inside comments by preserving comment leader on new lines.
---     - Supports nested sessions (expand snippet while there is an active one).
---   See |MiniSnippets.default_insert()|.
---
--- - Exported function to parse snippet body into easy-to-reason data structure.
---   See |MiniSnippets.parse()|.
---
--- Notes:
--- - It does not set up any snippet collection by default. Explicitly populate
---   `config.snippets` to have snippets to match from.
--- - It does not come with a built-in snippet collection. It is expected from
---   users to add their own snippets, manually or with dedicated plugin(s).
--- - It does not support variable/tabstop transformations in default snippet
---   session. This requires ECMAScript Regular Expression parser which can not
---   be implemented concisely.

--- # Dependencies ~
---
--- This module doesn't come with snippet collection. Either create it manually
--- or install a dedicated plugin. For example, 'rafamadriz/friendly-snippets'.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.snippets').setup({})` (replace `{}`
--- with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniSnippets` which
--- you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniSnippets.*`).
---
--- See |MiniSnippets.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minisnippets_config` which should have same structure as
--- `Minisnippets.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'L3MON4D3/LuaSnip':
---     - Both contain functionality to load snippets from file system.
---       This module provides several common loader generators while 'LuaSnip'
---       contains a more elaborate loading setup.
---       Also both require explicit opt-in for which snippets to load.
---     - Both support LSP snippet format. 'LuaSnip' also provides own more
---       elaborate snippet format which is out of scope for this module.
---     - 'LuaSnip' can autoexpand snippets, while this module always requires
---       an explicit user action to expand (by design).
---     - Both contain snippet expand functionality which differs in some aspects:
---         - 'LuaSnip' has an elaborate dynamic tabstop visualization config.
---           This module provides a handful of dedicated highlight groups.
---         - This module provides configurable visualization of empty tabstops.
---         - 'LusSnip' implements nested sessions by essentially merging them
---           into one. This module treats each nested session separately (to not
---           visually overload) while storing them in stack (first in last out).
---         - 'LuaSnip' uses |Select-mode| to power replacing current tabstop,
---           while this module always stays in |Insert-mode|. This enables easier
---           mapping understanding and more targeted highlighting.
---         - This module implements jumping which wraps after final tabstop
---           for more flexible navigation (enhanced with by a more flexible
---           autostopping rules), while 'LuaSnip' autostops session once
---           jumping reached the final tabstop.
---
--- - Built-in |vim.snippet| (on Neovim>=0.10):
---     - Does not contain functionality to load or match snippets (by design),
---       while this module does.
---     - Both contain expand functionality based on LSP snippet format.
---       Differences in how snippet sessions are handled are similar to
---       comparison with 'LuaSnip'.
---
--- - 'rafamadriz/friendly-snippets':
---     - A snippet collection plugin without features to manage or expand them.
---       This module is designed with 'friendly-snippets' compatibility in mind.
---
--- - 'abeldekat/cmp-mini-snippets':
---     - A source for 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' that integrates 'mini.snippets'.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniSnippetsCurrent` - current tabstop.
--- * `MiniSnippetsCurrentReplace` - current tabstop, placeholder is to be replaced.
--- * `MiniSnippetsFinal` - special `$0` tabstop.
--- * `MiniSnippetsUnvisited` - not yet visited tabstop(s).
--- * `MiniSnippetsVisited` - visited tabstop(s).
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable core functionality, set `vim.g.minisnippets_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.minisnippets_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
--- of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
--- for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- `POSITION`        Table representing position in a buffer. Fields:
---                 - <line> `(number)` - line number (starts at 1).
---                 - <col> `(number)` - column number (starts at 1).
---
--- `REGION`          Table representing region in a buffer.
---                 Fields: <from> and <to> for inclusive start/end POSITIONs.
---
--- `SNIPPET`         Data about template to insert. Should contain fields:
---                 - <prefix> - string snippet identifier.
---                 - <body> - string snippet content with appropriate syntax.
---                 - <desc> - string snippet description in human readable form.
---                 Can also be used to mean snippet body if distinction is clear.
---
--- `SNIPPET SESSION` Interactive state for user to adjust inserted snippet.
---
--- `MATCHED SNIPPET` SNIPPET which contains <region> field with REGION that
---                 matched it. Usually region needs to be removed.
---
--- `SNIPPET NODE`    Unit of parsed SNIPPET body. See |MiniSnippets.parse()|.
---
--- `TABSTOP`         Dedicated places in SNIPPET body for users to interactively
---                 adjust. Specified in snippet body with `$` followed by digit(s).
---
--- `LINKED TABSTOPS` Different nodes assigned the same tabstop. Updated in sync.
---
--- `REFERENCE NODE`  First (from left to right) node of linked tabstops.
---                 Used to determine synced text and cursor placement after jump.
---
--- `EXPAND`          Action to start snippet session based on currently typed text.
---                 Always done in current buffer at cursor. Executed steps:
---                 - `PREPARE` - resolve raw config snippets at context.
---                 - `MATCH` - match resolved snippets at cursor position.
---                 - `SELECT` - possibly choose among matched snippets.
---                 - `INSERT` - insert selected snippet and start snippet session.

--- Snippet is a template for a frequently used text. Typical workflow is to type
--- snippet's (configurable) prefix and expand it into a snippet session: add some
--- pre-defined text and allow user to interactively change/add at certain places.
---
--- This overview assumes default config for mappings and expand.
--- See |MiniSnippets.config| and |MiniSnippets-examples| for more details.
---
--- # Snippet structure ~
---
--- Snippet consists from three parts:
--- - `Prefix` - identifier used to match against current text.
--- - `Body` - actually inserted content with appropriate syntax.
--- - `Desc` - description in human readable form.
---
--- Example: `{ prefix = 'tis', body = 'This is snippet', desc = 'Snip' }`
--- Typing `tis` and pressing "expand" mapping (<C-j> by default) will remove "tis",
--- add "This is snippet", and place cursor at the end in Insert mode.
---
---                                              *MiniSnippets-syntax-specification*
--- # Syntax ~
---
--- Inserting just text after typing smaller prefix is already powerful enough.
--- For more flexibility, snippet body can be formatted in a special way to
--- provide extra features. This module implements support for syntax defined
--- in LSP specification (with small deviations). See this link for reference:
--- https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.18/specification/#snippet_syntax
---
--- A quick overview of basic syntax features:
---
--- - Tabstops are snippet parts meant for interactive editing at their location.
---   They are denoted as `$1`, `$2`, etc.
---   Navigating between them is called "jumping" and is done in numerical order
---   of tabstop identifiers by pressing special keys: <C-l> and <C-h> to jump
---   to next and previous tabstop respectively.
---   Special tabstop `$0` is called "final tabstop": it is used to decide when
---   snippet session is automatically stopped and is visited last during jumping.
---
---   Example: `T1=$1 T2=$2 T0=$0` is expanded as `T1= T2= T0=` with three tabstops.
---
--- - Tabstop can have placeholder: a text used if tabstop is not yet edited.
---   Text is preserved if no editing is done. It follows this same syntax, which
---   means it can itself contain tabstops with placeholders (i.e. be nested).
---   Tabstop with placeholder is denoted as `${1:placeholder}` (`$1` is `${1:}`).
---
---   Example: `T1=${1:text} T2=${2:<$1>}` is expanded as `T1=text T2=<text>`;
---            typing `x` at first placeholder results in `T1=x T2=<x>`;
---            jumping once and typing `y` results in `T1=x T2=y`.
---
--- - There can be several tabstops with same identifier. They are linked and
---   updated in sync during text editing. Can also have different placeholders;
---   they are forced to be the same as in the first (from left to right) tabstop.
---
---   Example: `T1=${1:text} T1=$1` is expanded as `T1=text T1=text`;
---            typing `x` at first placeholder results in `T1=x T1=x`.
---
--- - Tabstop can also have choices: suggestions about tabstop text. It is denoted
---   as `${1|a,b,c|}`. First choice is used as placeholder.
---
---   Example: `T1=${1|left,right|}` is expanded as `T1=left`.
---
--- - Variables can be used to automatically insert text without user interaction.
---   As tabstops, each one can have a placeholder which is used if variable is
---   not defined. There is a special set of variables describing editor state.
---
---   Example: `V1=$TM_FILENAME V2=${NOTDEFINED:placeholder}` is expanded as
---            `V1=current-file-basename V2=placeholder`.
---
--- What's different from LSP specification:
--- - Special set of variables is wider and is taken from VSCode specification:
---   https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables
---   Exceptions are `BLOCK_COMMENT_START` and `BLOCK_COMMENT_END` as Neovim doesn't
---   provide this information.
--- - Variable `TM_SELECTED_TEXT` is resolved as contents of |quote_quote| register.
---   It assumes that text is put there prior to expanding. For example, visually
---   select, press |c|, type prefix, and expand.
---   See |MiniSnippets-examples| for how to adjust this.
--- - Environment variables are recognized and supported: `V1=$VIMRUNTIME` will
---   use an actual value of |$VIMRUNTIME|.
--- - Variable transformations are not supported during snippet session. It would
---   require interacting with ECMAScript-like regular expressions for which there
---   is no easy way in Neovim. It may change in the future.
---   Transformations are recognized during parsing, though, with some exceptions:
---     - The `}` inside `if` of `${1:?if:else}` needs escaping (for technical reasons).
---
--- There is a |MiniSnippets.parse()| function for programmatically parsing
--- snippet body into a comprehensible data structure.
---
--- # Expand ~
---
--- Using snippets is done via what is called "expanding". It goes like this:
--- - Type snippet prefix or its recognizable part.
--- - Press <C-j> to expand. It will perform the following steps:
---     - Prepare available snippets in current context (buffer + local language).
---       This allows snippet setup to have general function loaders which return
---       different snippets in different contexts.
---     - Match text to the left of cursor with available prefixes. It first tries
---       to do exact match and falls back to fuzzy matching.
---     - If there are several matches, use `vim.ui.select()` to choose one.
---     - Insert single matching snippet. If snippet contains tabstops, start
---       snippet session.
---
--- For more details about each step see:
--- - |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()|
--- - |MiniSnippets.default_match()|
--- - |MiniSnippets.default_select()|
--- - |MiniSnippets.default_insert()|
---
--- Snippet session allows interactive editing at tabstop locations:
---
--- - All tabstop locations are visualized depending on tabstop "state" (whether
---   it is current/visited/unvisited/final and whether it was already edited).
---   Empty tabstops are visualized with inline virtual text ("•"/"∎" for
---   regular/final tabstops). It is removed after session is stopped.
---
--- - Start session at first tabstop. Type text to replace placeholder.
---   When finished with current tabstop, jump to next with <C-l>. Repeat.
---   If changed mind about some previous tabstop, jump back with <C-h>.
---   Jumping also wraps around the edge (first tabstop is next after final).
---
--- - If tabstop has choices, use <C-n> / <C-p> to select next / previous item.
---
--- - Starting another snippet session while there is an active one is allowed.
---   This creates nested sessions: suspend current, start the new one.
---   After newly created is stopped, resume the suspended one.
---
--- - Stop session manually by pressing <C-c> or make it stop automatically:
---   if final tabstop is current either make a text edit or exit to Normal mode.
---   If snippet doesn't explicitly define final tabstop, it is added at the end
---   of the snippet.
---
--- For more details about snippet session see |MiniSnippets-session|.
---
--- To select and insert snippets via completion engine (that supports LSP
--- completion; like |mini.completion| or |lsp-autocompletion|),
--- call |MiniSnippets.start_lsp_server()| after |MiniSnippets.setup()|. This sets up
--- an LSP server that matches and provides snippets loaded with 'mini.snippets'.
--- To match with completion engine, use `start_lsp_server({ match = false })`.
---
--- # Management ~
---
--- Out of the box 'mini.snippets' doesn't load any snippets, it should be done
--- explicitly inside |MiniSnippets.setup()| following |MiniSnippets.config|.
---
--- The suggested approach to snippet management is to create dedicated files with
--- snippet data and load them through function loaders in `config.snippets`.
--- See |MiniSnippets-examples| for basic (yet capable) snippet management config.
---
---                                                *MiniSnippets-file-specification*
--- General idea of supported files is to have at least out of the box experience
--- with common snippet collections. Namely "rafamadriz/friendly-snippets".
--- The following files are supported:
---
--- - Extensions:
---     - Read/decoded as JSON object (|vim.json.decode()|): `*.json`, `*.code-snippets`
---     - Executed as Lua file (|dofile()|) and uses returned value: `*.lua`
---
--- - Content:
---     - Dict-like: object in JSON; returned table in Lua; no order guarantees.
---     - Array-like: array in JSON; returned array table in Lua; preserves order.
---
--- Example of file content with a single snippet:
--- - Lua dict-like:   `return { name = { prefix = 't', body = 'Text' } }`
--- - Lua array-like:  `return { { prefix = 't', body = 'Text', desc = 'name' } }`
--- - JSON dict-like:  `{ "name": { "prefix": "t", "body": "Text" } }`
--- - JSON array-like: `[ { "prefix": "t", "body": "Text", "desc": "name" } ]`
---
--- General advice:
--- - Put files in "snippets" subdirectory of any path in 'runtimepath' (like
---   "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/snippets/global.json").
---   This is compatible with |MiniSnippets.gen_loader.from_runtime()| and
---   example from |MiniSnippets-examples|.
--- - Prefer `*.json` files with dict-like content if you want more cross platfrom
---   setup. Otherwise use `*.lua` files with array-like content.
---
--- Notes:
--- - There is no built-in support for VSCode-like "package.json" files. Define
---   structure manually in |MiniSnippets.setup()| via built-in or custom loaders.
--- - There is no built-in support for `scope` field of snippet data. Snippets are
---   expected to be manually separated into smaller files and loaded on demand.
---
--- For supported snippet syntax see |MiniSnippets-syntax-specification|.
---
--- # Demo ~
---
--- The best way to grasp the design of snippet management and expansion is to
--- try them out yourself. Here are steps for a basic demo:
--- - Create 'snippets/global.json' file in the config directory with the content: >
---
---   {
---     "Basic":        { "prefix": "ba", "body": "T1=$1 T2=$2 T0=$0"         },
---     "Placeholders": { "prefix": "pl", "body": "T1=${1:aa}\nT2=${2:<$1>}"  },
---     "Choices":      { "prefix": "ch", "body": "T1=${1|a,b|} T2=${2|c,d|}" },
---     "Linked":       { "prefix": "li", "body": "T1=$1\n\tT1=$1"            },
---     "Variables":    { "prefix": "va", "body": "Runtime: $VIMRUNTIME\n"    },
---     "Complex":      {
---       "prefix": "co",
---       "body": [ "T1=${1:$RANDOM}", "T3=${3:$1_${2:$1}}", "T2=$2" ]
---     }
---   }
--- <
--- - Set up 'mini.snippets' as recommended in |MiniSnippets-examples|.
--- - Open Neovim. Type each snippet prefix and press <C-j> (even if there is
---   still active session). Explore from there.

--- # Basic snippet management config ~
---
--- Example of snippet management setup that should cover most cases: >lua
---
---   -- Setup
---   local gen_loader = require('mini.snippets').gen_loader
---   require('mini.snippets').setup({
---     snippets = {
---       -- Load custom file with global snippets first
---       gen_loader.from_file('~/.config/nvim/snippets/global.json'),
---
---       -- Load snippets based on current language by reading files from
---       -- "snippets/" subdirectories from 'runtimepath' directories.
---       gen_loader.from_lang(),
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- This setup allows having single file with custom "global" snippets (will be
--- present in every buffer) and snippets which will be loaded based on the local
--- language (see |MiniSnippets.gen_loader.from_lang()|).
---
--- Create language snippets manually (by creating and populating
--- '$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/snippets/lua.json' file) or by installing dedicated
--- snippet collection plugin (like 'rafamadriz/friendly-snippets').
---
--- Note: all built-in loaders and |MiniSnippets.read_file()| cache their output
--- by default. It means that after a file is first read, changing it won't have
--- effect during current Neovim session. See |MiniSnippets.gen_loader| about how
--- to reset cache if necessary.
---
--- # Select from all available snippets in current context ~
---
--- With |MiniSnippets.default_match()|, expand snippets (<C-j> by default) at line
--- start or after whitespace. To be able to always select from all current
--- context snippets, make mapping similar to the following: >lua
---
---   local rhs = function() MiniSnippets.expand({ match = false }) end
---   vim.keymap.set('i', '<C-g><C-j>', rhs, { desc = 'Expand all' })
--- <
--- # "Supertab"-like <Tab> / <S-Tab> mappings ~
---
--- This module intentionally by default uses separate keys to expand and jump as
--- it enables cleaner use of nested sessions. Here is an example of setting up
--- custom <Tab> to "expand or jump" and <S-Tab> to "jump to previous": >lua
---
---   local snippets = require('mini.snippets')
---   local match_strict = function(snips)
---     -- Do not match with whitespace to cursor's left
---     return snippets.default_match(snips, { pattern_fuzzy = '%S+' })
---   end
---   snippets.setup({
---     -- ... Set up snippets ...
---     mappings = { expand = '', jump_next = '', jump_prev = '' },
---     expand   = { match = match_strict },
---   })
---   local expand_or_jump = function()
---     local can_expand = #MiniSnippets.expand({ insert = false }) > 0
---     if can_expand then vim.schedule(MiniSnippets.expand); return '' end
---     local is_active = MiniSnippets.session.get() ~= nil
---     if is_active then MiniSnippets.session.jump('next'); return '' end
---     return '\t'
---   end
---   local jump_prev = function() MiniSnippets.session.jump('prev') end
---   vim.keymap.set('i', '<Tab>', expand_or_jump, { expr = true })
---   vim.keymap.set('i', '<S-Tab>', jump_prev)
--- <
--- # Stop session immediately after jumping to final tabstop ~
---
--- Utilize a dedicated |MiniSnippets-events|: >lua
---
---   local fin_stop = function(args)
---     if args.data.tabstop_to == '0' then MiniSnippets.session.stop() end
---   end
---   local au_opts = { pattern = 'MiniSnippetsSessionJump', callback = fin_stop }
---   vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', au_opts)
--- <
--- # Stop all sessions on Normal mode exit ~
---
--- Use |ModeChanged| and |MiniSnippets-events| events: >lua
---
---   local make_stop = function()
---     local au_opts = { pattern = '*:n', once = true }
---     au_opts.callback = function()
---       while MiniSnippets.session.get() do

--- # Customize variable evaluation ~

---
---   -- Compute custom lookup for variables with dynamic values
---   local insert_with_lookup = function(snippet)

---       TM_SELECTED_TEXT = table.concat(vim.fn.getreg('a', true, true), '\n'),
---     }
---     return MiniSnippets.default_insert(snippet, { lookup = lookup })
---   end
---
---   require('mini.snippets').setup({
---     -- ... Set up snippets ...
---     expand = { insert = insert_with_lookup },
---   })
--- <
--- # Using Neovim's built-ins to insert snippet ~
---
--- Define custom `expand.insert` in |MiniSnippets.config| and mappings: >lua
---
---   require('mini.snippets').setup({

---@text # Loaded snippets ~
---
--- `config.snippets` is an array containing snippet data which can be: snippet
--- table, function loader, or (however deeply nested) array of snippet data.
---
--- Snippet is a table with the following fields:
---
--- - <prefix> `(string|table|nil)` - string used to match against current text.
---    If array, all strings should be used as separate prefixes.
--- - <body> `(string|table|nil)` - content of a snippet which should follow
---    the |MiniSnippets-syntax-specification|. Array is concatenated with "\n".
--- - <desc> `(string|table|nil)` - description of snippet. Can be used to display
---   snippets in a more human readable form. Array is concatenated with "\n".
---
--- Function loaders are expected to be called with single `context` table argument
--- (containing any data about current context) and return same as `config.snippets`
--- data structure.
---
--- `config.snippets` is resolved with `config.prepare` on every expand.
--- See |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()| for how it is done by default.
---
--- For a practical example see |MiniSnippets-examples|.
--- Here is an illustration of `config.snippets` customization capabilities: >lua
---
---   local gen_loader = require('mini.snippets').gen_loader
---   require('mini.snippets').setup({
---     snippets = {
---       -- Load custom file with global snippets first (order matters)
---       gen_loader.from_file('~/.config/nvim/snippets/global.json'),
---
---       -- Or add them here explicitly
---       { prefix='cdate', body='$CURRENT_YEAR-$CURRENT_MONTH-$CURRENT_DATE' },
---
---       -- Load snippets based on current language by reading files from
---       -- "snippets/" subdirectories from 'runtimepath' directories.
---       gen_loader.from_lang(),
---
---       -- Load project-local snippets with `gen_loader.from_file()`
---       -- and relative path (file doesn't have to be present)
---       gen_loader.from_file('.vscode/project.code-snippets'),
---
---       -- Custom loader for language-specific project-local snippets
---       function(context)
---         local rel_path = '.vscode/' .. context.lang .. '.code-snippets'
---         if vim.fn.filereadable(rel_path) == 0 then return end
---         return MiniSnippets.read_file(rel_path)
---       end,
---
---       -- Ensure that some prefixes are not used (as there is no `body`)
---       { prefix = { 'bad', 'prefix' } },
---     }
---   })
--- <
--- # Mappings ~
---
--- `config.mappings` describes which mappings are automatically created.
---
--- `mappings.expand` is created globally in Insert mode and is used to expand
--- snippet at cursor. Use |MiniSnippets.expand()| for custom mappings.
---
--- `mappings.jump_next`, `mappings.jump_prev`, and `mappings.stop` are created for
--- the duration of active snippet session(s) from |MiniSnippets.default_insert()|.
--- Used to jump to next/previous tabstop and stop active session respectively.
--- Use |MiniSnippets.session.jump()| and |MiniSnippets.session.stop()| for custom
--- Insert mode mappings.
--- Note: do not use `"<C-n>"` or `"<C-p>"` for any action as they conflict with
--- built-in completion: it forces them to mean "change focus to next/previous
--- completion item". This matters more frequently than when there is a tabstop
--- with choices due to how this module handles built-in completion during jumps.
---
--- # Expand ~
---
--- `config.expand` defines expand steps (see |MiniSnippets-glossary|), either after
--- pressing `mappings.expand` or starting manually via |MiniSnippets.expand()|.
---
--- `expand.prepare` is a function that takes `raw_snippets` in the form of
--- `config.snippets` and should return a plain array of snippets (as described
--- in |MiniSnippets-glossary|). Will be called on every |MiniSnippets.expand()| call.
--- If returns second value, it will be used as context for warning messages.
--- Default: |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()|.
---
--- `expand.match` is a function that takes `expand.prepare` output and returns
--- an array of matched snippets: one or several snippets user might intend to
--- eventually insert. Should sort matches in output from best to worst.
--- Entries can contain `region` field with current buffer region used to do
--- the match; usually it needs to be removed (similar to how |ins-completion|
--- and |abbreviations| work).
--- Default: |MiniSnippets.default_match()|
---
--- `expand.select` is a function that takes output of `expand.match` and function
--- that inserts snippet (and also ensures Insert mode and removes snippet's match
--- region). Should allow user to perform interactive snippet selection and
--- insert the chosen one. Designed to be compatible with |vim.ui.select()|.
--- Called for any non-empty `expand.match` output (even with single entry).
--- Default: |MiniSnippets.default_select()|
---
--- `expand.insert` is a function that takes single snippet table as input and
--- inserts snippet at cursor position. This is a main entry point for adding
--- text template to buffer and starting a snippet session.
--- If called inside |MiniSnippets.expand()| (which is a usual interactive case),
--- all it has to do is insert snippet at cursor position. Ensuring Insert mode
--- and removing matched snippet region is done beforehand.
--- Default: |MiniSnippets.default_insert()|
---
--- Illustration of `config.expand` customization: >lua
---
---   -- Supply extra data as context
---   local my_p = function(raw_snippets)
---     local _, cont = MiniSnippets.default_prepare({})
---     cont.cursor = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor()
---     return MiniSnippets.default_prepare(raw_snippets, { context = cont })
---   end
---   -- Perform fuzzy match based only on alphanumeric characters
---   local my_m = function(snippets)
---     return MiniSnippets.default_match(snippets, { pattern_fuzzy = '%w*' })
---   end
---   -- Always insert the best matched snippet
---   local my_s = function(snippets, insert) return insert(snippets[1]) end
---   -- Use different string to show empty tabstop as inline virtual text
---   local my_i = function(snippet)
---     return MiniSnippets.default_insert(snippet, { empty_tabstop = '$' })
---   end
---
---   require('mini.snippets').setup({

---   - Use `insert = false` to return all matches without inserting.
---
---   Note: `opts.insert` is called after ensuring Insert mode, removing snippet's
---   match region, and positioning cursor.

--- Generate snippet loader
---
--- This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get a loader.
---
--- Common features for all produced loaders:
--- - Designed to work with |MiniSnippets-file-specification|.
--- - Cache output by default, i.e. second and later calls with same input value
---   don't read file system. Different loaders from same generator share cache.
---   Disable by setting `opts.cache` to `false`.
---   To clear all cache, call |MiniSnippets.setup()|. For example:
---   `MiniSnippets.setup(MiniSnippets.config)`
--- - Use |vim.notify()| to show problems during loading while trying to load as
---   much correctly defined snippet data as possible.
---   Disable by setting `opts.silent` to `true`.
MiniSnippets.gen_loader = {}

--- Generate language loader
---
--- Output loads files from "snippets/" subdirectories of 'runtimepath' matching
--- configured language patterns.
--- See |MiniSnippets.gen_loader.from_runtime()| for runtime loading details.
---
--- Language is taken from <lang> field (if present with string value) of `context`
--- argument used in loader calls during "prepare" stage.
--- This is compatible with |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()| and most snippet
--- collection plugins.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible values:
---   - <lang_patterns> `(table)` - map from language to array of runtime patterns
---     used to find snippet files, as in |MiniSnippets.gen_loader.from_runtime()|.
---     Patterns will be processed in order. With |MiniSnippets.default_prepare()|
---     it means if snippets have same prefix, data from later patterns is used.
---     To interactively check the current language with default context, execute
---     `:=MiniSnippets.default_prepare({})` and see data in the second table.
---
---     Default pattern array (for non-empty language) is constructed as to read
---     `*.json` and `*.lua` files that are:
---     - Inside "snippets/" subdirectory named as language (files can be however
---       deeply nested).
---     - Named as language and is in "snippets/" directory (however deep).
---     Example for "lua" language: >lua
---     { 'lua/**/*.json', 'lua/**/*.lua', '**/lua.json', '**/lua.lua' }
--- <
---     Add entry for `""` (empty string) as language to be sourced when `lang`
---     context is empty string (which is usually temporary scratch buffers).

--- Generate runtime loader
---
--- Output loads files which match `pattern` inside "snippets/" directories from
--- 'runtimepath'. This is useful to simultaneously read several similarly
--- named files from different sources. Order from 'runtimepath' is preserved.
---
--- Typical case is loading snippets for a language from files like `xxx.{json,lua}`
--- but located in different "snippets/" directories inside 'runtimepath'.
--- - `<config>`/snippets/lua.json - manually curated snippets in user config.
--- - `<path/to/installed/plugin>`/snippets/lua.json - from installed plugin.
--- - `<config>`/after/snippets/lua.json - used to adjust snippets from plugins.
---   For example, remove some snippets by using prefixes and no body.
---
---@param pattern string Pattern of files to read. Can have wildcards as described
---   in |nvim_get_runtime_file()|. Example for "lua" language: `'lua.{json,lua}'`.
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:

---     Note: caching is done per `pattern` value, which assumes that both
---     'runtimepath' value and snippet files do not change during Neovim session.

--- Default prepare
---
--- Normalize raw snippets (as in `snippets` from |MiniSnippets.config|) based on
--- supplied context:
--- - Traverse and flatten nested arrays. Function loaders are executed with
---   `opts.context` as argument and output is processed recursively.
--- - Ensure unique non-empty prefixes: later ones completely override earlier
---   ones (similar to how |ftplugin| and similar runtime design behave).
---   Empty string prefixes are all added (to allow inserting without matching).
--- - Transform and infer fields:
---     - Multiply array `prefix` into several snippets with same body/description.
---       Infer absent `prefix` as empty string.
---     - Concatenate array `body` with "\n". Do not infer absent `body` to have
---       it remove previously added snippet with the same prefix.
---     - Concatenate array `desc` with "\n". Infer `desc` field from `description`
---       (for compatibility) or `body` fields, in that order.
--- - Sort output by prefix.
---
--- Unlike |MiniSnippets.gen_loader| entries, there is no output caching. This
--- avoids duplicating data from `gen_loader` cache and reduces memory usage.
--- It also means that every |MiniSnippets.expand()| call prepares snippets, which
--- is usually fast enough. If not, consider manual caching: >lua
---
---   local cache = {}
---   local prepare_cached = function(raw_snippets)
---     local _, cont = MiniSnippets.default_prepare({})
---     local id = 'buf=' .. cont.buf_id .. ',lang=' .. cont.lang
---     if cache[id] then return unpack(vim.deepcopy(cache[id])) end

---     language) fields. Language is computed from tree-sitter parser at cursor
---     (allows different snippets in injected languages), 'filetype' otherwise.
---
---@return ... Array of snippets and supplied context (default if none was supplied).
MiniSnippets.default_prepare = function(raw_snippets, opts)

end

--- Default match
---
--- Match snippets based on the line before cursor.
---
--- Tries two matching approaches consecutively:
--- - Find exact snippet prefix (if present and non-empty) to the left of cursor.
---   It should also be preceded with a byte that matches `pattern_exact_boundary`.
---   In case of any match, return the one with the longest prefix.
--- - Match fuzzily snippet prefixes against the base (text to the left of cursor
---   extracted via `opts.pattern_fuzzy`). Matching is done via |matchfuzzy()|.
---   Empty base results in all snippets being matched. Return all fuzzy matches.
---
---@param snippets table Array of snippets which can be matched.
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:
---   - <pattern_exact_boundary> `(string)` - Lua pattern for the byte to the left
---     of exact match to accept it. Line start is matched against empty string;
---     use `?` quantifier to allow it as boundary.
---     Default: `[%s%p]?` (accept only whitespace and punctuation as boundary,

--- Default insert
---
--- Prepare for snippet insert and do it:
--- - Ensure Insert mode.
--- - Delete snippet's match region (if present as <region> field). Ensure cursor.
--- - Parse snippet body with |MiniSnippets.parse()| and enabled `normalize`.
---   In particular, evaluate variables, ensure final node presence and same
---   text for nodes with same tabstops. Stop if not able to.
--- - Insert snippet at cursor:
---     - Add snippet's text. Lines are split at "\n".
---       Indent and left comment leaders (inferred from 'commentstring' and
---       'comments') of current line are repeated on the next.
---       Tabs ("\t") are expanded according to 'expandtab' and 'shiftwidth'.
---     - If there is an actionable tabstop (not final), start snippet session.
---
---                                                           *MiniSnippets-session*
--- # Session life cycle ~
---
--- - Start with cursor at first tabstop. If there are linked tabstops, cursor
---   is placed at start of reference node (see |MiniSnippets-glossary|).
---   All tabstops are visualized with dedicated highlight groups (see "Highlight
---   groups" section in |MiniSnippets|).
---   Empty tabstops are visualized with inline virtual text ("•"/"∎" for
---   regular/final tabstops) meaning that it is not an actual text in the
---   buffer and will be removed after session is stopped.
---
--- - Decide whether you want to replace the placeholder. If not, jump to next or
---   previous tabstop. If yes, edit it: add new and/or delete already added text.
---   While doing so, several things happen in all linked tabstops (if any):
---
---     - After first typed character the placeholder is removed and highlighting
---       changes from `MiniSnippetsCurrentReplace` to `MiniSnippetsCurrent`.
---     - Text in all tabstop nodes is synchronized with the reference one.
---       Relative indent of reference tabstop's text is preserved: all but first
---       lines in linked tabstops are reindented based on the first line indent.
---       Note: text sync is forced only for current tabstop (for performance).
---
--- - Jump with <C-l> / <C-h> to next / previous tabstop. Exact keys can be
---   adjusted in |MiniSnippets.config| `mappings`.
---   See |MiniSnippets.session.jump()| for jumping details.
---
--- - If tabstop has choices, all of them are shown after each jump and deleting
---   tabstop text. It is done with |complete()|, so use <C-n> / <C-p> to select
---   next / previous choice. Type text to narrow down the list.
---   Works best when 'completeopt' option contains `menuone` and `noselect` flags.
---   Note: deleting character hides the list due to how |complete()| works;
---   delete whole tabstop text (for example with one or more |i_CTRL-W|) for
---   full list to reappear.
---
--- - Nest another session by expanding snippet in the same way as without
---   active session (can be even done in another buffer). If snippet has no
---   actionable tabstop, text is just inserted. Otherwise start nested session:
---
---     - Suspend current session: hide highlights, keep text change tracking.
---     - Start new session and act as if it is the only one (edit/jump/nest).
---     - When ready (possibly after even more nested sessions), stop the session.
---       This will resume previous one: sync text for its current tabstop and
---       show highlighting.
---       The experience of text synchronization only after resuming session is
---       similar to how editing in |visual-block| mode works.
---       Nothing else (like cursor/mode/buffer) is changed for a smoother
---       automated session stop.
---
---   Notes about the choice of the "session stack" approach to nesting over more
---   common "merge into single session" approach:
---   - Does not overload with highlighting.
---   - Allows nested sessions in different buffers.
---   - Doesn't need a complex logic of injecting one session into another.
---
--- - Repeat edit/jump/nest steps any number of times.
---
--- - Stop. It can be done in two ways:
---
---     - Manually by pressing <C-c> or calling |MiniSnippets.session.stop()|.
---       Exact key can be adjusted in |MiniSnippets.config| `mappings`.
---     - Automatically: any text edit or switching to Normal mode stops session
---       if final tabstop (`$0`) is current. Its presence is ensured after insert.
---       Not stopping session right away after jumping to final mode (as most
---       other snippet plugins do) allows going back to other tabstops in case
---       of a late missed typo. Wrapping around the edge during jumping also
---       helps with that.
---       If current tabstop is not final, exiting into Normal mode for quick edit
---       outside of snippets range (or carefully inside) is fine. Later get back
---       into Insert mode and jump to next tabstop or manually stop session.
---   See |MiniSnippets-examples| for how to set up custom stopping rules.
---
--- Use |MiniSnippets.session.get()| to get data about active/nested session(s).
--- Use |MiniSnippets.session.jump()| / |MiniSnippets.session.stop()| in mappings.
---
--- What is allowed but not officially supported/recommended:
---
--- - Editing text within snippet range but outside of session life cycle. Mostly
---   behaves as expected, but may harm tracking metadata (|extmarks|).
---   In general anything but deleting tabstop range should be OK.
---   Text synchronization of current tabstop would still be active.
