---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Test action is defined as a named callable entry of a table.
---
--- - Helper for creating child Neovim process which is designed to be used in
---   tests (including taking and verifying screenshots). See
---   |MiniTest.new_child_neovim()| and |Minitest.expect.reference_screenshot()|.
---
--- - Hierarchical organization of tests with custom hooks, parametrization,
---   and user data. See |MiniTest.new_set()|.
---
--- - Emulation of 'Olivine-Labs/busted' interface (`describe`, `it`, etc.).
---
--- - Predefined small yet usable set of expectations (`assert`-like functions).
---   See |MiniTest.expect|.
---
--- - Customizable definition of what files should be tested.
---
--- - Test case filtering. There are predefined wrappers for testing a file
---   (|MiniTest.run_file()|) and case at a location like current cursor position
---   (|MiniTest.run_at_location()|).
---
--- - Customizable reporter of output results. There are two predefined ones:
---     - |MiniTest.gen_reporter.buffer()| for interactive usage.
---     - |MiniTest.gen_reporter.stdout()| for headless Neovim.
---
--- - Customizable project specific testing script.
---
--- What it doesn't support:
--- - Parallel execution. Due to idea of limiting implementation complexity.
---
--- - Mocks, stubs, etc. Use child Neovim process and manually override what is
---   needed. Reset child process it afterwards.
---
--- - "Overly specific" expectations. Tests for (no) equality and (absence of)
---   errors usually cover most of the needs. Adding new expectations is a
---   subject to weighing its usefulness against additional implementation
---   complexity. Use |MiniTest.new_expectation()| to create custom ones.
---
--- For more information see:
--- - 'TESTING.md' file for a hands-on introduction based on examples.
---
--- - Code of this plugin's tests. Consider it to be an example of intended
---   way to use 'mini.test' for test organization and creation.
---
--- # Workflow
---
--- - Organize tests in separate files. Each test file should return a test set
---   (explicitly or implicitly by using "busted" style functions).
---
--- - Write test actions as callable entries of test set. Use child process
---   inside test actions (see |MiniTest.new_child_neovim()|) and builtin
---   expectations (see |MiniTest.expect|).
---
--- - Run tests. This does two steps:
---     - *Collect*. This creates single hierarchical test set, flattens into
---       array of test cases (see |MiniTest-test-case|) while expanding with
---       parametrization, and possibly filters them.
---     - *Execute*. This safely calls hooks and main test actions in specified
---       order while allowing reporting progress in asynchronous fashion.
---       Detected errors means test case fail; otherwise - pass.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.test').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniTest`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniTest.*`).
---
--- See |MiniTest.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minitest_config` which should have same structure as `MiniTest.config`.
--- See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - Testing infrastructure from 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim':
---     - Executes each file in separate headless Neovim process with customizable
---       'init.vim' file. While 'mini.test' executes everything in current
---       Neovim process encouraging writing tests with help of manually
---       managed child Neovim process (see |MiniTest.new_child_neovim()|).
---     - Tests are expected to be written with embedded simplified versions of
---       'Olivine-Labs/busted' and 'Olivine-Labs/luassert'. While 'mini.test'
---       uses concepts of test set (see |MiniTest.new_set()|) and test case
---       (see |MiniTest-test-case|). It also can emulate bigger part of
---       "busted" framework.
---     - Has single way of reporting progress (shows result after every case
---       without summary). While 'mini.test' can have customized reporters
---       with defaults for interactive and headless usage (provide more
---       compact and user-friendly summaries).
---     - Allows parallel execution, while 'mini.test' does not.
---     - Allows making mocks, stubs, and spies, while 'mini.test' does not in
---       favor of manually overwriting functionality in child Neovim process.
---
--- Although 'mini.test' supports emulation of "busted style" testing, it will
--- be more stable to use its designed approach of defining tests (with
--- `MiniTest.new_set()` and explicit table fields). Couple of reasons:
--- - "Busted" syntax doesn't support full capabilities offered by 'mini.test'.
---   Mainly it is about parametrization and supplying user data to test sets.
--- - It is an emulation, not full support. So some subtle things might not
---   work the way you expect.
---
--- Some hints for converting from 'plenary.nvim' tests to 'mini.test':
--- - Rename files from "***_spec.lua" to "test_***.lua" and put them in
---   "tests" directory.
--- - Replace `assert` calls with 'mini.test' expectations. See |MiniTest.expect|.
--- - Create main test set `T = MiniTest.new_set()` and eventually return it.
--- - Make new sets (|MiniTest.new_set()|) from `describe` blocks. Convert
---   `before_each()` and `after_each` to `pre_case` and `post_case` hooks.
--- - Make test cases from `it` blocks.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniTestEmphasis` - emphasis highlighting. By default it is a bold text.
--- * `MiniTestFail` - highlighting of failed cases. By default it is a bold
---   text with `vim.g.terminal_color_1` color (red).
--- * `MiniTestPass` - highlighting of passed cases. By default it is a bold
---   text with `vim.g.terminal_color_2` color (green).
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.minitest_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.minitest_disable`
--- (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
--- and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
--- recipes.

-- Module data ================================================================
--- Table with information about current state of test execution
---
--- Use it to examine result of |MiniTest.execute()|. It is reset at the
--- beginning of every call.
---
--- At least these keys are supported:
--- - <all_cases> - array with all cases being currently executed. Basically,
---   an input of `MiniTest.execute()`.
--- - <case> - currently executed test case. See |MiniTest-test-case|. Use it
---   to customize execution output (like adding custom notes, etc).
MiniTest.current = { all_cases = nil, case = nil }

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Create test set
---
--- Test set is one of the two fundamental data structures. It is a table that
--- defines hierarchical test organization as opposed to sequential
--- organization with |MiniTest-test-case|.
---
--- All its elements are one of three categories:
--- - A callable (object that can be called; function or table with `__call`
---   metatble entry) is considered to define a test action. It will be called
---   with "current arguments" (result of all nested `parametrize` values, read
---   further). If it throws error, test has failed.
--- - A test set (output of this function) defines nested structure. Its
---   options during collection (see |MiniTest.collect()|) will be extended
---   with options of this (parent) test set.
--- - Any other elements are considered helpers and don't directly participate
---   in test structure.
---
--- Set options allow customization of test collection and execution (more
--- details in `opts` description):
--- - `hooks` - table with elements that will be called without arguments at
---   predefined stages of test execution.
--- - `parametrize` - array defining different arguments with which main test
---   actions will be called. Any non-trivial parametrization will lead to
---   every element (even nested) be "multiplied" and processed with every
---   element of `parametrize`. This allows handling many different combination
---   of tests with little effort.
--- - `data` - table with user data that will be forwarded to cases. Primary
---   objective is to be used for customized case filtering.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Preferred way of adding elements is by using syntax `T[name] = element`.
---   This way order of added elements will be preserved. Any other way won't
---   guarantee any order.
--- - Supplied options `opts` are stored in `opts` field of metatable
---   (`getmetatable(set).opts`).
---
---@param opts table|nil Allowed options:
---   - <hooks> - table with fields:
---       - <pre_once> - executed before first filtered node.
---       - <pre_case> - executed before each case (even nested).
---       - <post_case> - executed after each case (even nested).
---       - <post_once> - executed after last filtered node.
---   - <parametrize> - array where each element is itself an array of
---     parameters to be appended to "current parameters" of callable fields.
---     Note: don't use plain `{}` as it is equivalent to "parametrization into
---     zero cases", so no cases will be collected from this set. Calling test
---     actions with no parameters is equivalent to `{{}}` or not supplying
---     `parametrize` option at all.
---   - <data> - user data to be forwarded to cases. Can be used for a more
---     granular filtering.
---@param tbl table|nil Initial test items (possibly nested). Will be executed
---   without any guarantees on order.
---
---@return table A single test set.
---
---@usage >
---   -- Use with defaults
---   T = MiniTest.new_set()
---   T['works'] = function() MiniTest.expect.equality(1, 1) end
---
---   -- Use with custom options. This will result into two actual cases: first
---   -- will pass, second - fail.
---   T['nested'] = MiniTest.new_set({
---     hooks = { pre_case = function() _G.x = 1 end },
---     parametrize = { { 1 }, { 2 } }
---   })
---
---   T['nested']['works'] = function(x)
---     MiniTest.expect.equality(_G.x, x)
---   end
MiniTest.new_set = function(opts, tbl)
  opts = opts or {}
  tbl = tbl or {}

  -- Keep track of new elements order. This allows to iterate through elements
  -- in order they were added.

  metatbl.__newindex = function(t, key, value)

--- Test case
---
--- An item of sequential test organization, as opposed to hierarchical with
--- test set (see |MiniTest.new_set()|). It is created as result of test
--- collection with |MiniTest.collect()| to represent all necessary information
--- of test execution.
---
--- Execution of test case goes by the following rules:
--- - Call functions in order:
---     - All elements of `hooks.pre` from first to last without arguments.
---     - Field `test` with arguments unpacked from `args`.
---     - All elements of `hooks.post` from first to last without arguments.
--- - Error in any call gets appended to `exec.fails`, meaning error in any
---   hook will lead to test fail.
--- - State (`exec.state`) is changed before every call and after last call.
---
---@class Test-case
---
---@field args table Array of arguments with which `test` will be called.
---@field data table User data: all fields of `opts.data` from nested test sets.
---@field desc table Description: array of fields from nested test sets.
---@field exec table|nil Information about test case execution. Value of `nil` means
---   that this particular case was not (yet) executed. Has following fields:
---     - <fails> - array of strings with failing information.
---     - <notes> - array of strings with non-failing information.
---     - <state> - state of test execution. One of:
---         - 'Executing <name of what is being executed>' (during execution).
---         - 'Pass' (no fails, no notes).
---         - 'Pass with notes' (no fails, some notes).
---         - 'Fail' (some fails, no notes).
---         - 'Fail with notes' (some fails, some notes).
---@field hooks table Hooks to be executed as part of test case. Has fields
---   <pre> and <post> with arrays to be consecutively executed before and
---   after execution of `test`.
---@field test function|table Main callable object representing test action.
---@tag MiniTest-test-case

--- Skip rest of current callable execution
---
--- Can be used inside hooks and main test callable of test case. Note: at the
--- moment implemented as a specially handled type of error.
---
---@param msg string|nil Message to be added to current case notes.
MiniTest.skip = function(msg)
  H.cache.error_is_from_skip = true
  error(msg or 'Skip test', 0)
end

--- Add note to currently executed test case
---
--- Appends `msg` to `exec.notes` field of |MiniTest.current.case|.
---
---@param msg string Note to add.
MiniTest.add_note = function(msg)
  local case = MiniTest.current.case
  case.exec = case.exec or {}
  case.exec.notes = case.exec.notes or {}
  table.insert(case.exec.notes, msg)
end

--- Register callable execution after current callable
---
--- Can be used inside hooks and main test callable of test case.
---
---@param f function|table Callable to be executed after current callable is
---   finished executing (regardless of whether it ended with error or not).
MiniTest.finally = function(f) H.cache.finally = f end

--- Run tests
---
--- - Try executing project specific script at path `opts.script_path`. If
---   successful (no errors), then stop.
--- - Collect cases with |MiniTest.collect()| and `opts.collect`.
--- - Execute collected cases with |MiniTest.execute()| and `opts.execute`.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options with structure similar to |MiniTest.config|.
---   Absent values are inferred from there.
MiniTest.run = function(opts)
  if H.is_disabled() then return end

  -- Try sourcing project specific script first
  local success = H.execute_project_script(opts)

  -- Collect and execute
  opts = H.get_config(opts)
  local cases = MiniTest.collect(opts.collect)
  MiniTest.execute(cases, opts.execute)
end

--- Run specific test file
---
--- Basically a |MiniTest.run()| wrapper with custom `collect.find_files` option.
---
---@param file string|nil Path to test file. By default a path of current buffer.
---@param opts table|nil Options for |MiniTest.run()|.
MiniTest.run_file = function(file, opts)

  opts = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', opts or {}, stronger_opts)

  MiniTest.run(opts)
end

--- Run case(s) covering location
---
--- Try filtering case(s) covering location, meaning that definition of its
--- main `test` action (as taken from builtin `debug.getinfo`) is located in
--- specified file and covers specified line. Note that it can result in
--- multiple cases if they come from parametrized test set (see `parametrize`
--- option in |MiniTest.new_set()|).
---
--- Basically a |MiniTest.run()| wrapper with custom `collect.find_files` option.
---
---@param location table|nil Table with fields <file> (path to file) and <line>
---   (line number in that file). Default is taken from current cursor position.
MiniTest.run_at_location = function(location, opts)
  if location == nil then
    local cur_file = vim.fn.fnamemodify(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0), ':.')
    local cur_pos = vim.api.nvim_win_get_cursor(0)
    location = { file = cur_file, line = cur_pos[1] }
  end

end

--- Collect test cases
---
--- Overview of collection process:
--- - If `opts.emulate_busted` is `true`, temporary make special global
---   functions (removed at the end of collection). They can be used inside
---   test files to create hierarchical structure of test cases.
--- - Source each file from array output of `opts.find_files`. It should output
---   a test set (see |MiniTest.new_set()|) or `nil` (if "busted" style is used;
---   test set is created implicitly).
--- - Combine all test sets into single set with fields equal to its file path.
--- - Convert from hierarchical test configuration to sequential: from single
---   test set to array of test cases (see |MiniTest-test-case|). Conversion is
---   done in the form of "for every table element do: for every `parametrize`
---   element do: ...". Details:
---     - If element is a callable, construct test case with it being main
---       `test` action. Description is appended with key of element in current
---       test set table. Hooks, arguments, and data are taken from "current
---       nested" ones. Add case to output array.
---     - If element is a test set, process it in similar, recursive fashion.
---       The "current nested" information is expanded:
---         - `args` is extended with "current element" from `parametrize`.
---         - `desc` is appended with element key.
---         - `hooks` are appended to their appropriate places. `*_case` hooks
---           will be inserted closer to all child cases than hooks from parent
---           test sets: `pre_case` at end, `post_case` at start.
---         - `data` is extended via |vim.tbl_deep_extend()|.
---     - Any other element is not processed.
--- - Filter array with `opts.filter_cases`. Note that input case doesn't contain
---   all hooks, as `*_once` hooks will be added after filtration.
--- - Add `*_once` hooks to appropriate cases.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options controlling case collection. Possible fields:
---   - <emulate_busted> - whether to emulate 'Olivine-Labs/busted' interface.
---     It emulates these global functions: `describe`, `it`, `setup`, `teardown`,
---     `before_each`, `after_each`. Use |MiniTest.skip()| instead of `pending()`
---     and |MiniTest.finally()| instead of `finally`.
---   - <find_files> - function which when called without arguments returns
---     array with file paths. Each file should be a Lua file returning single
---     test set or `nil`.
---   - <filter_cases> - function which when called with single test case
---     (see |MiniTest-test-case|) returns `false` if this case should be filtered
---     out; `true` otherwise.
---
---@return table Array of test cases ready to be used by |MiniTest.execute()|.

end

--- Execute array of test cases
---
--- Overview of execution process:
--- - Reset `all_cases` in |MiniTest.current| with `cases` input.
--- - Call `reporter.start(cases)` (if present).
--- - Execute each case in natural array order (aligned with their integer
---   keys). Set `MiniTest.current.case` to currently executed case. Detailed
---   test case execution is described in |MiniTest-test-case|. After any state
---   change, call `reporter.update(case_num)` (if present), where `case_num` is an
---   integer key of current test case.
--- - Call `reporter.finish()` (if present).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Execution is done in asynchronous fashion with scheduling. This allows
---   making meaningful progress report during execution.
--- - This function doesn't return anything. Instead, it updates `cases` in
---   place with proper `exec` field. Use `all_cases` at |MiniTest.current| to
---   look at execution result.
---
---@param cases table Array of test cases (see |MiniTest-test-case|).
---@param opts table|nil Options controlling case collection. Possible fields:
---   - <reporter> - table with possible callable fields `start`, `update`,
---     `finish`. Default: |MiniTest.gen_reporter.buffer()| in interactive
---     usage and |MiniTest.gen_reporter.stdout()| in headless usage.
---   - <stop_on_error> - whether to stop execution (see |MiniTest.stop()|)
---     after first error. Default: `false`.

-- Reporters ------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Table with pre-configured report generators
---
--- Each element is a function which returns reporter - table with callable
--- `start`, `update`, and `finish` fields.
MiniTest.gen_reporter = {}

--- Generate buffer reporter
---
--- This is a default choice for interactive (not headless) usage. Opens a window
--- with dedicated non-terminal buffer and updates it with throttled redraws.
---
--- Opened buffer has the following helpful Normal mode mappings:
--- - `<Esc>` - stop test execution if executing (see |MiniTest.is_executing()|
---   and |MiniTest.stop()|). Close window otherwise.
--- - `q` - same as `<Esc>` for convenience and compatibility.
---
--- General idea:
--- - Group cases by concatenating first `opts.group_depth` elements of case
---   description (`desc` field). Groups by collected files if using default values.
--- - In `start()` show some stats to know how much is scheduled to be executed.
--- - In `update()` show symbolic overview of current group and state of current
---   case. Each symbol represents one case and its state:
---     - `?` - case didn't finish executing.
---     - `o` - pass.
---     - `O` - pass with notes.
---     - `x` - fail.
---     - `X` - fail with notes.
--- - In `finish()` show all fails and notes ordered by case.
---
---@param opts table|nil Table with options. Used fields:
---   - <group_depth> - number of first elements of case description (can be zero)
---     used for grouping. Higher values mean higher granularity of output.
---     Default: 1.
---   - <throttle_delay> - minimum number of milliseconds to wait between
---     redrawing. Reduces screen flickering but not amount of computations.
---     Default: 10.
---   - <window> - definition of window to open. Can take one of the forms:
---       - Callable. It is called expecting output to be target window id
---         (current window is used if output is `nil`). Use this to open in
---         "normal" window (like `function() vim.cmd('vsplit') end`).
---       - Table. Used as `config` argument in |nvim_open_win()|.
---     Default: table for centered floating window.
MiniTest.gen_reporter.buffer = function(opts)
  -- NOTE: another choice of implementing this is to use terminal buffer
  -- `vim.api.nvim_open_term()`.
  -- Pros:
  -- - Renders ANSI escape sequences (mostly) correctly, i.e. no need in
  --   replacing them with Neovim range highlights.
  -- - This reporter and `stdout` one can share more of a codebase.
  -- Cons:
  -- - Couldn't manage to implement "redraw on every update".
  -- - Extra steps still are needed in order to have richer output information.
  --   This involves ANSI sequences that move cursor, which have same issues as
  --   in `stdout`, albeit easier to overcome:
  --     - Handling of scroll.
  --     - Hard wrapping of lines leading to need of using window width.

--- Child class
---
--- It offers a great set of tools to write reliable and reproducible tests by
--- allowing to use fresh process in any test action. Interaction with it is done
--- through |RPC| protocol.
---
--- Although quite flexible, at the moment it has certain limitations:
--- - Doesn't allow using functions or userdata for child's both inputs and
---   outputs. Usual solution is to move computations from current Neovim process
---   to child process. Use `child.lua()` and `child.lua_get()` for that.
--- - When writing tests, it is common to end up with "hanging" process: it
---   stops executing without any output. Most of the time it is because Neovim
---   process is "blocked", i.e. it waits for user input and won't return from
---   other call (like `child.api.nvim_exec_lua()`). Common causes are active
---   |hit-enter-prompt| (increase prompt height to a bigger value) or
---   Operator-pending mode (exit it). To mitigate this experience, most helpers
---   will throw an error if its immediate execution will lead to hanging state.
---   Also in case of hanging state try `child.api_notify` instead of `child.api`.
---
--- Notes:
--- - An important type of field is a "redirection table". It acts as a
---   convenience wrapper for corresponding `vim.*` table. Can be used both to
---   return and set values. Examples:
---     - `child.api.nvim_buf_line_count(0)` will execute
---       `vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(0)` inside child process and return its
---       output to current process.
---     - `child.bo.filetype = 'lua'` will execute `vim.bo.filetype = 'lua'`
---       inside child process.
---   They still have same limitations listed above, so are not perfect. In
---   case of a doubt, use `child.lua()`.
--- - Almost all methods use |vim.rpcrequest()| (i.e. wait for call to finish and
---   then return value). See for `*_notify` variant to use |vim.rpcnotify()|.
--- - All fields and methods should be called with `.`, not `:`.
---
---@class child
---
---@field start function Start child process. See |MiniTest-child-neovim.start()|.
---@field stop function Stop current child process.
---@field restart function Restart child process: stop if running and then
---   start a new one. Takes same arguments as `child.start()` but uses values
---   from most recent `start()` call as defaults.
---
---@field type_keys function Emulate typing keys.
---   See |MiniTest-child-neovim.type_keys()|. Doesn't check for blocked state.
---
---@field cmd function Execute Vimscript code from a string.
---   A wrapper for |nvim_exec()| without capturing output.
---@field cmd_capture function Execute Vimscript code from a string and
---   capture output. A wrapper for |nvim_exec()| with capturing output.
---
---@field lua function Execute Lua code. A wrapper for |nvim_exec_lua()|.
---@field lua_notify function Execute Lua code without waiting for output.
---@field lua_get function Execute Lua code and return result. A wrapper
---   for |nvim_exec_lua()| but prepends string code with `return`.
---@field lua_func function Execute Lua function and return it's result.
---   Function will be called with all extra parameters (second one and later).
---   Note: usage of upvalues (data from outside function scope) is not allowed.
---
---@field is_blocked function Check whether child process is blocked.
---@field is_running function Check whether child process is currently running.
---
---@field ensure_normal_mode function Ensure normal mode.
---@field get_screenshot function Returns table with two "2d arrays" of single
---   characters representing what is displayed on screen and how it looks.
---   Has `opts` table argument for optional configuratnion.
---
---@field job table|nil Information about current job. If `nil`, child is not running.
---
---@field api table Redirection table for `vim.api`. Doesn't check for blocked state.
---@field api_notify table Same as `api`, but uses |vim.rpcnotify()|.
---
---@field diagnostic table Redirection table for |vim.diagnostic|.
---@field fn table Redirection table for |vim.fn|.
---@field highlight table Redirection table for `vim.highlight` (|lua-highlight)|.
---@field json table Redirection table for `vim.json`.
---@field loop table Redirection table for |vim.loop|.
---@field lsp table Redirection table for `vim.lsp` (|lsp-core)|.
---@field mpack table Redirection table for |vim.mpack|.
---@field spell table Redirection table for |vim.spell|.
---@field treesitter table Redirection table for |vim.treesitter|.
---@field ui table Redirection table for `vim.ui` (|lua-ui|). Currently of no
---   use because it requires sending function through RPC, which is impossible
---   at the moment.
---
---@field g table Redirection table for |vim.g|.
---@field b table Redirection table for |vim.b|.
---@field w table Redirection table for |vim.w|.
---@field t table Redirection table for |vim.t|.

--- child.get_screenshot() ~
---
--- Compute what is displayed on (default TUI) screen and how it is displayed.
--- This basically calls |screenstring()| and |screenattr()| for every visible
--- cell (row from 1 to 'lines', column from 1 to 'columns').
---
--- Notes:
--- - Due to implementation details of `screenstring()` and `screenattr()` in
---   Neovim<=0.7, this function won't recognize floating windows displayed on
---   screen. It will throw an error if there is a visible floating window. Use
---   Neovim>=0.8 (current nightly) to properly handle floating windows. Details:
---     - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19013
---     - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/19020
--- - To make output more portable and visually useful, outputs of
---   `screenattr()` are coded with single character symbols. Those are taken from
---   94 characters (ASCII codes between 33 and 126), so there will be duplicates
---   in case of more than 94 different ways text is displayed on screen.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possieble fields:
---   - <redraw> `(boolean)` - whether to call |:redraw| prior to computing
---     screenshot. Default: `true`.
---
---@return table|nil Screenshot table with the following fields:
---   - <text> - "2d array" (row-column) of single characters displayed at
---     particular cells.
---   - <attr> - "2d array" (row-column) of symbols representing how text is
---     displayed (basically, "coded" appearance/highlighting). They should be
---     used only in relation to each other: same/different symbols for two
---     cells mean same/different visual appearance. Note: there will be false
---     positives if there are more than 94 different attribute values.
---   It also can be used with `tostring()` to convert to single string (used
---   for writing to reference file). It results into two visual parts
---   (separated by empty line), for `text` and `attr`. Each part has "ruler"
---   above content and line numbers for each line.
---   Returns `nil` if couldn't get a reasonable screenshot.
