--- *mini.ai* Extend and create a/i textobjects

--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Enhance some builtin |text-objects| (like |a(|, |a)|, |a'|, and more),
--- create new ones (like `a*`, `a<Space>`, `af`, `a?`, and more), and allow
--- user to create their own.
---
--- Features:
--- - Customizable creation of `a`/`i` textobjects using Lua patterns and functions.
---   Supports:
---     - Dot-repeat.
---     - |v:count|.
---     - Different search methods (see |MiniAi.config|).
---     - Consecutive application (update selection without leaving Visual mode).
---     - Aliases for multiple textobjects.
---
--- - Comprehensive builtin textobjects (see more in |MiniAi-textobject-builtin|):
---     - Balanced brackets (with and without whitespace) plus alias.
---     - Balanced quotes plus alias.
---     - Function call.
---     - Argument.
---     - Tag.
---     - Derived from user prompt.
---     - Default for punctuation, digit, or whitespace single character.
---
--- - Motions for jumping to left/right edge of textobject.
---
--- - Set of specification generators to tweak some builtin textobjects (see
---   |MiniAi.gen_spec|).
---
--- - Treesitter textobjects (through |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()| helper).
---
--- This module works by defining mappings for both `a` and `i` in Visual and
--- Operator-pending mode. After typing, they wait for single character user input
--- treated as textobject identifier and apply resolved textobject specification
--- (fall back to other mappings if can't find proper textobject id). For more
--- information see |MiniAi-textobject-specification| and |MiniAi-algorithm|.
---
--- Known issues which won't be resolved:
--- - Search for builtin textobjects is done mostly using Lua patterns
---   (regex-like approach). Certain amount of false positives is to be expected.
---
--- - During search for builtin textobjects there is no distinction if it is
---   inside string or comment. For example, in the following case there will
---   be wrong match for a function call: `f(a = ")", b = 1)`.
---
--- General rule of thumb: any instrument using available parser for document
--- structure (like treesitter) will usually provide more precise results. This
--- module has builtins mostly for plain text textobjects which are useful
--- most of the times (like "inside brackets", "around quotes/underscore", etc.).
--- For advanced use cases define function specification for custom textobjects.
---
--- What it doesn't (and probably won't) do:
--- - Have special operators to specially handle whitespace (like `I` and `A`
---   in 'targets.vim'). Whitespace handling is assumed to be done inside
---   textobject specification (like `i(` and `i)` handle whitespace differently).
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.ai').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniAi`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniAi.*`).
---
--- See |MiniAi.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like `config.custom_textobjects`)
--- locally to buffer inside `vim.b.miniai_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniAi.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'wellle/targets.vim':
---     - Has limited support for creating own textobjects: it is constrained
---       to pre-defined detection rules. 'mini.ai' allows creating own rules
---       via Lua patterns and functions (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).
---     - Doesn't provide any programmatical API for getting information about
---       textobjects. 'mini.ai' does it via |MiniAi.find_textobject()|.
---     - Has no implementation of "moving to edge of textobject". 'mini.ai'
---       does it via |MiniAi.move_cursor()| and `g[` and `g]` default mappings.
---     - Has elaborate ways to control searching of the next textobject.
---       'mini.ai' relies on handful of 'config.search_method'.
---     - Implements `A`, `I` operators. 'mini.ai' does not by design: it is
---       assumed to be a property of textobject, not operator.
---     - Doesn't implement "function call" and "user prompt" textobjects.
---       'mini.ai' does (with `f` and `?` identifiers).
---     - Has limited support for "argument" textobject. Although it works in
---       most situations, it often misdetects commas as argument separator
---       (like if it is inside quotes or `{}`). 'mini.ai' deals with these cases.
--- - 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects':
---     - Along with textobject functionality provides a curated and maintained
---       set of popular textobject queries for many languages (which can power
---       |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()| functionality).
---     - Operates with custom treesitter directives (see
---       |lua-treesitter-directives|) allowing more fine-tuned textobjects.
---     - Implements only textobjects based on treesitter.
---     - Doesn't support |v:count|.
---     - Doesn't support multiple search method (basically, only 'cover').
---     - Doesn't support consecutive application of target textobject.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.miniai_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.miniai_disable`
--- (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
--- and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
--- recipes.

--- Builtin textobjects ~
---
--- This table describes all builtin textobjects along with what they
--- represent. Explanation:
--- - `Key` represents the textobject identifier: single character which should
---   be typed after `a`/`i`.
--- - `Name` is a description of textobject.
--- - `Example line` contains a string for which examples are constructed. The
---   `*` denotes the cursor position.
--- - `a`/`i` describe inclusive region representing `a` and `i` textobjects.
---   Use numbers in separators for easier navigation.
--- - `2a`/`2i` describe either `2a`/`2i` (support for |v:count|) textobjects
---   or `a`/`i` textobject followed by another `a`/`i` textobject (consecutive
---   application leads to incremental selection).
---
--- Example: typing `va)` with cursor on `*` leads to selection from column 2
--- to column 12. Another typing `a)` changes selection to [1; 13]. Also, besides
--- visual selection, any |operator| can be used or `g[`/`g]` motions to move
--- to left/right edge of `a` textobject.

--- Notes:
--- - All examples assume default `config.search_method`.
--- - Open brackets differ from close brackets by how they treat inner edge
---   whitespace for `i` textobject: open ignores it, close - includes.
--- - Default textobject is activated for identifiers from digits (0, ..., 9),
---   punctuation (like `_`, `*`, `,`, etc.), whitespace (space, tab, etc.).
---   They are designed to be treated as separators, so include only right edge
---   in `a` textobject. To include both edges, use custom textobjects
---   (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification| and |MiniAi.config|).
---@tag MiniAi-textobject-builtin

--- - REGION - table representing region in a buffer. Fields:
---     - <from> and <to> for inclusive start and end positions (<to> might be
---       `nil` to describe empty region). Each position is also a table with
---       line <line> and column <col> (both start at 1).
---     - <vis_mode> for which Visual mode will be used to select textobject.
---       See `opts` argument of |MiniAi.select_textobject()|.
---       One of `'v'`, `'V'`, `'\22'` (escaped `'<C-v>'`).
---   Examples:
---   - `{ from = { line = 1, col = 1 }, to = { line = 2, col = 1 } }`
---   - Force linewise mode: >
---     {
---       from = { line = 1, col = 1 }, to = { line = 2, col = 1 },
---       vis_mode = 'V',
---     }
--- <  - Empty region: `{ from = { line = 10, col = 10 } }`
--- - PATTERN - string describing Lua pattern.
--- - SPAN - interval inside a string (end-exclusive). Like [1, 5). Equal
---   `from` and `to` edges describe empty span at that point.
--- - SPAN `A = [a1, a2)` COVERS `B = [b1, b2)` if every element of
---   `B` is within `A` (`a1 <= b < a2`).
---   It also is described as B IS NESTED INSIDE A.
--- - NESTED PATTERN - array of patterns aimed to describe nested spans.
--- - SPAN MATCHES NESTED PATTERN if there is a sequence of consecutively
---   nested spans each matching corresponding pattern within substring of
---   previous span (or input string for first span). Example:
---     Nested patterns: `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$' }` (balanced `()` with inner space)
---     Input string: `( ( () ( ) ) )`
---                   `123456789012345`
---   Here are all matching spans [1, 15) and [3, 13). Both [5, 7) and [8, 10)
---   match first pattern but not second. All other combinations of `(` and `)`
---   don't match first pattern (not balanced).
--- - COMPOSED PATTERN: array with each element describing possible pattern
---   (or array of them) at that place. Composed pattern basically defines all
---   possible combinations of nested pattern (their cartesian product).
---   Examples:
---     1. Composed pattern: `{ { '%b()', '%b[]' }, '^. .* .$' }`
---        Composed pattern expanded into equivalent array of nested patterns:
---         `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$' }` and `{ '%b[]', '^. .* .$' }`
---        Description: either balanced `()` or balanced `[]` but both with
---        inner edge space.
---     2. Composed pattern:
---        `{ { { '%b()', '^. .* .$' }, { '%b[]', '^.[^ ].*[^ ].$' } }, '.....' }`
---        Composed pattern expanded into equivalent array of nested patterns:
---        `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$', '.....' }` and
---        `{ '%b[]', '^.[^ ].*[^ ].$', '.....' }`
---        Description: either "balanced `()` with inner edge space" or
---        "balanced `[]` with no inner edge space", both with 5 or more characters.
--- - SPAN MATCHES COMPOSED PATTERN if it matches at least one nested pattern
---   from expanded composed pattern.
---@tag MiniAi-glossary

--- Textobject specification has a structure of composed pattern (see
--- |MiniAi-glossary|) with two differences:
--- - Last pattern(s) should have even number of empty capture groups denoting
---   how the last string should be processed to extract `a` or `i` textobject:
---     - Zero captures mean that whole string represents both `a` and `i`.
---       Example: `xxx` will define textobject matching string `xxx` literally.
---     - Two captures represent `i` textobject inside of them. `a` - whole string.
---       Example: `x()x()x` defines `a` textobject to be `xxx`, `i` - middle `x`.
---     - Four captures define `a` textobject inside captures 1 and 4, `i` -
---       inside captures 2 and 3. Example: `x()()x()x()` defines `a`
---       textobject to be last `xx`, `i` - middle `x`.
--- - Allows callable objects (see |vim.is_callable()|) in certain places
---   (enables more complex textobjects in exchange of increase in configuration
---   complexity and computations):
---     - If specification itself is a callable, it will be called with the same
---       arguments as |MiniAi.find_textobject()| and should return one of:
---         - Composed pattern. Useful for implementing user input. Example of
---           simplified variant of textobject for function call with name taken
---           from user prompt: >
---
---           function()
---             local left_edge = vim.pesc(vim.fn.input('Function name: '))
---             return { string.format('%s+%%b()', left_edge), '^.-%(().*()%)$' }
---           end
--- <
---         - Single output region. Useful to allow full control over
---           textobject. Will be taken as is. Example of returning whole buffer: >
---
---           function()
---             local from = { line = 1, col = 1 }
---             local to = {
---               line = vim.fn.line('$'),
---               col = math.max(vim.fn.getline('$'):len(), 1)
---             }
---             return { from = from, to = to, vis_mode = 'V' }
---           end
--- <
---         - Array of output region(s). Useful for incorporating other
---           instruments, like treesitter (see |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()|).
---           The best region will be picked in the same manner as with composed
---           pattern (respecting options `n_lines`, `search_method`, etc.).
---           Example of selecting "best" line with display width more than 80: >
---
---           function(_, _, _)
---             local res = {}
---             for i = 1, vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(0) do
---               local cur_line = vim.fn.getline(i)
---               if vim.fn.strdisplaywidth(cur_line) > 80 then
---                 local region = {
---                   from = { line = i, col = 1 },
---                   to = { line = i, col = cur_line:len() },
---                 }
---                 table.insert(res, region)
---               end
---             end
---             return res
---           end
--- <
---     - If there is a callable instead of assumed string pattern, it is expected
---       to have signature `(line, init)` and behave like `pattern:find()`.
---       It should return two numbers representing span in `line` next after
---       or at `init` (`nil` if there is no such span).
---       !IMPORTANT NOTE!: it means that output's `from` shouldn't be strictly
---       to the left of `init` (it will lead to infinite loop). Not allowed as
---       last item (as it should be pattern with captures).
---       Example of matching only balanced parenthesis with big enough width: >
---
---         {
---           '%b()',
---           function(s, init)
---             if init > 1 or s:len() < 5 then return end
---             return 1, s:len()
---           end,
---           '^.().*().$'
---         }
--- <
--- More examples:
--- - See |MiniAi.gen_spec| for function wrappers to create commonly used
---   textobject specifications.
---
--- - Pair of balanced brackets from set (used for builtin `b` identifier):
---   `{ { '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }, '^.().*().$' }`
---
--- - Imitate word ignoring digits and punctuation (supports only Latin alphabet):
---   `{ '()()%f[%w]%w+()[ \t]*()' }`
---
--- - Word with camel case support (also supports only Latin alphabet):
---   `{`
---     `{`
---       `'%u[%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
---       `'%f[%S][%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
---       `'%f[%P][%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
---       `'^[%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
---     `},`
---     `'^().*()$'`
---   `}`
---
--- - Number: `{ '%f[%d]%d+' }`
---
--- - Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format: `{ '()%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d()' }`
---
--- - Lua block string: `{ '%[%[().-()%]%]' }`
---@tag MiniAi-textobject-specification

--- Algorithm design
---
--- Search for the textobjects relies on these principles:
--- - It uses same input data as described in |MiniAi.find_textobject()|,
---   i.e. whether it is `a` or `i` textobject, its identifier, reference region, etc.
--- - Textobject specification is constructed based on textobject identifier
---   (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).
--- - General search is done by converting some 2d buffer region (neighborhood
---   of reference region) into 1d string (each line is appended with `\n`).
---   Then search for a best span matching textobject specification is done
---   inside string (see |MiniAi-glossary|). After that, span is converted back
---   into 2d region. Note: first search is done inside reference region lines,
---   and only after that - inside its neighborhood within `config.n_lines`
---   (see |MiniAi.config|).
--- - The best matching span is chosen by iterating over all spans matching
---   textobject specification and comparing them with "current best".
---   Comparison also depends on reference region (tighter covering is better,
---   otherwise closer is better) and search method (if span is even considered).
--- - Extract span based on extraction pattern (last item in nested pattern).
--- - If task is to perform a consecutive search (`opts.n_times` is greater than 1),
---   steps are repeated with current best match becoming reference region.
---   One such additional step is also done if final region is equal to
---   reference region (this enables consecutive application).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Iteration over all matched spans is done in depth-first fashion with
---   respect to nested pattern.
--- - It is guaranteed that span is compared only once.
--- - For the sake of increasing functionality, during iteration over all
---   matching spans, some Lua patterns in composed pattern are handled
---   specially.
---     - `%bxx` (`xx` is two identical characters). It denotes balanced pair
---       of identical characters and results into "paired" matches. For
---       example, `%b""` for `"aa" "bb"` would match `"aa"` and `"bb"`, but
---       not middle `" "`.
---     - `x.-y` (`x` and `y` are different strings). It results only in matches with
---       smallest width. For example, `e.-o` for `e e o o` will result only in
---       middle `e o`. Note: it has some implications for when parts have
---       quantifiers (like `+`, etc.), which usually can be resolved with
---       frontier pattern `%f[]` (see examples in |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).

---
--- ## Search method ~
---
--- Value of `config.search_method` defines how best match search is done.
--- Based on its value, one of the following matches will be selected:
--- - Covering match. Left/right edge is before/after left/right edge of
---   reference region.
--- - Previous match. Left/right edge is before left/right edge of reference
---   region.
--- - Next match. Left/right edge is after left/right edge of reference region.
--- - Nearest match. Whichever is closest among previous and next matches.
---
--- Possible values are:
--- - `'cover'` - use only covering match. Don't use either previous or
---   next; report that there is no textobject found.
--- - `'cover_or_next'` (default) - use covering match. If not found, use next.
--- - `'cover_or_prev'` - use covering match. If not found, use previous.
--- - `'cover_or_nearest'` - use covering match. If not found, use nearest.
--- - `'next'` - use next match.
--- - `'prev'` - use previous match.
--- - `'nearest'` - use nearest match.
---
--- Note: search is first performed on the reference region lines and only
--- after failure - on the whole neighborhood defined by `config.n_lines`. This
--- means that with `config.search_method` not equal to `'cover'`, "prev" or
--- "next" textobject will end up as search result if they are found on first
--- stage although covering match might be found in bigger, whole neighborhood.
--- This design is based on observation that most of the time operation is done
--- within reference region lines (usually cursor line).
---
--- Here is an example of what `a)` textobject is based on a value of
--- `'config.search_method'` when cursor is inside `bbb` word:
--- - `'cover'`:         `(a) bbb (c)` -> none
--- - `'cover_or_next'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(c)`
--- - `'cover_or_prev'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(a)`
--- - `'cover_or_nearest'`: depends on cursor position.
---   For first and second `b` - as in `cover_or_prev` (as previous match is
---   nearer), for third - as in `cover_or_next` (as next match is nearer).
--- - `'next'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(c)`. Same outcome for `(bbb)`.
--- - `'prev'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(a)`. Same outcome for `(bbb)`.
--- - `'nearest'`: depends on cursor position (same as in `'cover_or_nearest'`).
---
--- ## Mappings ~
---
--- Mappings `around_next`/`inside_next` and `around_last`/`inside_last` are
--- essentially `around`/`inside` but using search method `'next'` and `'prev'`.
MiniAi.config = {
  -- Table with textobject id as fields, textobject specification as values.

---     custom_textobjects = {
---       -- Tweak argument to be recognized only inside `()` between `;`

---   })
MiniAi.gen_spec = {}

--- Argument specification
---
--- Argument textobject (has default `a` identifier) is a region inside
--- balanced bracket between allowed not excluded separators. Use this function
--- to tweak how it works.
---
--- Examples:
--- - `argument({ brackets = { '%b()' } })` will search for an argument only
---   inside balanced `()`.
--- - `argument({ separator = '[,;]' })` will treat both `,` and `;` as separators.
--- - `argument({ exclude_regions = { '%b()' } })` will exclude separators
---   which are inside balanced `()` (inside outer brackets).
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Allowed fields:
---   - <brackets> - array of patterns for outer balanced brackets.
---     Default: `{ '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }` (any `()`, `[]`, or `{}` can
---     enclose arguments).
---   - <separator> - separator pattern. Default: `','`.
---     One of the practical usages of this option is to include whitespace
---     around character to be a part of separator. For example, `'%s*,%s*'`
---     will treat as separator not only ',', but its possible surrounding
---     whitespace. This has both positive and negative effects. On one hand,
---     `daa` executed over the first argument will delete whitespace after
---     first comma, leading to a more expected outcome. On the other hand it
---     is ambiguous which argument is picked when cursor is over whitespace
---     near the character separator.
---   - <exclude_regions> - array with patterns for regions inside which
---     separators will be ignored.
---     Default: `{ '%b""', "%b''", '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }` (separators
---     inside balanced quotes or brackets are ignored).
MiniAi.gen_spec.argument = function(opts)

  }, opts or {})

  local res = {}
  -- Match brackets
  res[1] = brackets

  -- Match argument with both left and right separators/brackets

  end

  -- Make extraction part
  --
  -- Extraction of `a` type depends on argument number, `i` - as `a` but
  -- without separators and inner whitespace. The reason for this complex
  -- solution are the following requirements:
  -- - Don't match argument region when cursor is on the outer bracket.
  --   Example: `f(xxx)` should select argument only when cursor is on 'x'.
  -- - Don't select edge whitespace for first and last argument BUT MATCH WHEN
  --   CURSOR IS ON THEM which needs to match edge whitespace right until the
  --   extraction part. This is useful when working with padded brackets.
  --   Example for `f(  xx  ,  yy  )`:
  --     - `a` object should select 'xx  ,' when cursor is on all '  xx  ';
  --       should select ',  yy' when cursor is on all '  yy  '.
  --     - `i` object should select 'xx' when cursor is on all '  xx  ';
  --       should select 'yy' when cursor is on all '  yy  '.
  --
  -- At this stage whether argument is first, middle, last, or single is
  -- determined by presence of matching separator at either left or right edge.
  -- If edge matches separator pattern - it has separator. If not - a bracket.

--- Function call specification
---
--- Function call textobject (has default `f` identifier) is a region with some
--- characters followed by balanced `()`. Use this function to tweak how it works.
---
--- Example:
--- - `function_call({ name_pattern = '[%w_]' })` will recognize function name with
---   only alphanumeric or underscore (not dot).
---
---@param opts table|nil Optsion. Allowed fields:
---   - <name_pattern> - string pattern of character set allowed in function name.
---     Default: `'[%w_%.]'` (alphanumeric, underscore, or dot).
---     Note: should be enclosed in `[]`.

--- Pair specification
---
--- Use it to define textobject for region surrounded with `left` from left and
--- `right` from right. The `a` textobject includes both edges, `i` - excludes them.
---
--- Region can be one of several types (controlled with `opts.type`). All
--- examples are for default search method, `a` textobject, and use `'_'` as
--- both `left` and `right`:
--- - Non-balanced (`{ type = 'non-balanced' }`), default. Equivalent to using
---   `x.-y` as first pattern. Example: on line '_a_b_c_' it consecutively
---   matches '_a_', '_b_', '_c_'.
--- - Balanced (`{ type = 'balanced' }`). Equivalent to using `%bxy` as first
---   pattern. Example: on line '_a_b_c_' it consecutively matches '_a_', '_c_'.
---   Note: both `left` and `right` should be single character.
--- - Greedy (`{ type = 'greedy' }`). Like non-balanced but will select maximum
---   consecutive `left` and `right` edges. Example: on line '__a__b_' it
---   consecutively selects '__a__' and '__b_'. Note: both `left` and `right`
---   should be single character.
---
---@param left string Left edge.

---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:
---   - <type> - Type of a pair. One of `'non-balanced'` (default), `'balanced'`,
---   `'greedy'`.

--- Treesitter specification
---
--- This is a specification in function form. When called with a pair of
--- treesitter captures, it returns a specification function outputting an
--- array of regions that match corresponding (`a` or `i`) capture.
---
--- In order for this to work, apart from working treesitter parser for desired
--- language, user should have a reachable language-specific 'textobjects'
--- query (see |vim.treesitter.query.get()| or |get_query()|, depending on your
--- Neovim version).
--- The most straightforward way for this is to have 'textobjects.scm' query
--- file with treesitter captures stored in some recognized path. This is
--- primarily designed to be compatible with plugin
--- 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects', but can be used without it.
---
--- Two most common approaches for having a query file:
--- - Install 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects'. It has curated and
---   well maintained builtin query files for many languages with a standardized
---   capture names, like `function.outer`, `function.inner`, etc.
--- - Manually create file 'after/queries/<language name>/textobjects.scm' in
---   your |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME| directory. It should contain queries with
---   captures (later used to define textobjects). See |lua-treesitter-query|.
--- To verify that query file is reachable, run (example for "lua" language)
--- `:lua print(vim.inspect(vim.treesitter.query.get_files('lua', 'textobjects')))`
--- (output should have at least an intended file).
---
--- Example configuration for function definition textobject with
--- 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects' captures:
--- >
---   local spec_treesitter = require('mini.ai').gen_spec.treesitter
---   require('mini.ai').setup({
---     custom_textobjects = {
---       F = spec_treesitter({ a = '@function.outer', i = '@function.inner' }),
---       o = spec_treesitter({
---         a = { '@conditional.outer', '@loop.outer' },
---         i = { '@conditional.inner', '@loop.inner' },
---       })
---     }
---   })
--- <
--- Notes:
--- - By default query is done using 'nvim-treesitter' plugin if it is present
---   (falls back to builtin methods otherwise). This allows for a more
---   advanced features (like multiple buffer languages, custom directives, etc.).
---   See `opts.use_nvim_treesitter` for how to disable this.
--- - It uses buffer's |filetype| to determine query language.
--- - On large files it is slower than pattern-based textobjects. Still very
---   fast though (one search should be magnitude of milliseconds or tens of
---   milliseconds on really large file).
---
---@param ai_captures table Captures for `a` and `i` textobjects: table with
---   <a> and <i> fields with captures for `a` and `i` textobjects respectively.
---   Each value can be either a string capture (should start with `'@'`) or an
---   array of such captures (best among all matches will be chosen).
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible values:
---   - <use_nvim_treesitter> - whether to try to use 'nvim-treesitter' plugin
---     (if present) to do the query. It implements more advanced behavior at
---     cost of increased execution time. Provides more coherent experience if
---     'nvim-treesitter-textobjects' queries are used. Default: `true`.
