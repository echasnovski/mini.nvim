--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
--- - Show and manage special floating window displaying automatically updated
---   overview of current buffer text. Window takes up whole height of Neovim
---   instance and is fixed to a left/right side. Map content is computed by
---   taking all current lines, converting it to binary whitespace/non-whitespace
---   mask, rescaling to appropriate dimensions, and converting back to strings
---   consisting from special encoding symbols. All this is done **very fast** and
---   **asynchronously**. See |MiniMap.open()|, |MiniMap.refresh()|, |MiniMap.close()|,
---   |MiniMap.toggle()|, |MiniMap.toggle_side()|.
---   For a general overview and tips, see |mini.map-usage|.
---
--- - Show scrollbar next to map content. It represents current line and view
---   (top and bottom visible lines). Can be the only thing shown, making map
---   window a "pure scrollbar". See "Pure scrollbar config" section in
---   |MiniMap.config|.
---
--- - Highlight map lines representing certain data in current buffer. This is
---   done via extensible set of callables, called integrations (see
---   "Integrations" section in |MiniMap.config|). There are pre-built generators
---   for common integrations:
---     - Builtin search (as result of |/| and similar).
---     - Builtin diagnostic (taken from |vim.diagnostic.get()|).
---     - Git line status (with help of 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim', see
---       |gitsigns.get_hunks()|).
---   For more details see |MiniMap.gen_integration|.
---
--- - Focus on map window to quickly browse current (source) buffer. Moving inside
---   map window updates cursor position in source window enabling fast and
---   targeted buffer exploration. To focus back, hit `<CR>` to accept current
---   explored position or `<Esc>` to go back to original position. See
---   |MiniMap.toggle_focus()|.
---
--- - Customizable via |MiniMap.config| and/or `opts` argument of |MiniMap.open()|
---   or |MiniMap.refresh()|:
---     - Encoding symbols used to display binary information of different
---       resolution (default is 3x2). There are pre-built generators for
---       different basic character families and resolutions. See
---       |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols|.
---     - Scrollbar symbols, separate for line and view. Can have any width
---       (even zero, which virtually disables scrollbar).
---     - Integrations producing map line highlights.
---     - Window options: side (left/right), width, 'winblend', and more.
---
--- What it doesn't do:
--- - Automatically refresh when typing in Insert mode. Although it can be done in
---   non-blocking way, it still might introduce considerable computation overhead
---   (especially in very large files).
--- - Has more flexible window configuration. In case a full height floating
---   window obstructs vision of underlying buffers, use |MiniMap.toggle()| or
---   |MiniMap.toggle_side()|. Works best with global statusline.
--- - Provide autoopen functionality. Due to vast differences in user preference
---   of when map window should be shown, set up of automatic opening is left to
---   user. A common approach would be to call `MiniMap.open()` on |VimEnter| event.
---   If you use |MiniStarter|, you can modify `<CR>` buffer mapping: >
---
---   vim.cmd([[autocmd User MiniStarterOpened
---     \ lua vim.keymap.set(
---     \   'n',
---     \   '<CR>',
---     \   '<Cmd>lua MiniStarter.eval_current_item(); MiniMap.open()<CR>',
---     \   { buffer = true }
---     \ )]])
--- <
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.map').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniMap`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniMap.*`).
---
--- See |MiniMap.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like `config.modifiers`) locally
--- to buffer inside `vim.b.minimap_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniMap.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Dependencies ~
---
--- Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality for integrations):
--- - Plugin 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim' for Git status highlighting via
---   |MiniMap.gen_integration.gitsigns()|. If missing, no highlighting is added.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'wfxr/minimap.vim':
---     - 'mini.map' doesn't have dependencies while being as fast as written
---       in Rust dependency of 'minimap.vim'.
---     - 'mini.map' uses floating window, while 'minimap.vim' uses regular one.
---     - 'mini.map' provides slightly different visual interface with
---       scrollbar and integration counts.
---     - 'mini.map' allows encode symbols customization, 'minimap.vim' does not.
---     - 'mini.map' allows extending highlight integrations, while only
---       builtin search and git status are supported in 'minimap.vim'.
---     - 'mini.map' updates in asynchronous (non-blocking) fashion, 'minimap.vim'
---       does not.
---     - 'mini.map' can be used as a pure scrollbar, 'minimap.vim' can not.
--- - 'dstein64/nvim-scrollview':
---     - 'mini.map' has two-part scrollbar showing current line and view (with
---       variable height), while 'nvim-scrollview' shows only current view
---       (with fixed height).
---     - 'nvim-scrollview' respects folds, i.e. shows view of visible lines,
---       while 'mini.map' by design always shows view based on actual lines.
---     - 'nvim-scrollview' creates scrollbar which can be dragged with mouse,
---       while 'mini.nvim' does not, by design (use |MiniMap.toggle_focus()|).
---     - 'mini.map' can show buffer outline, while 'nvim-scrollview' can not.
---     - 'mini.map' can show highlight integrations, while 'nvim-scrollview'
---       can not.
--- - 'petertriho/nvim-scrollbar':
---     - 'mini.map' has two-part scrollbar showing current line and view (with
---       variable height), while 'nvim-scrollbar' shows only current view.
---     - 'mini.map' can show buffer outline, while 'nvim-scrollbar' can not.
---     - 'mini.map' has fully extendable highlight integrations, while
---       'nvim-scrollbar' only supports diagnostic and search (with dependency).
--- - 'lewis6991/satellite.nvim':
---     - Almost the same differences as with 'dstein64/nvim-scrollview', except
---       'satellite.nvim' can display some set of integration highlights.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniMapNormal` - basic highlight of whole window.
--- * `MiniMapSymbolCount` - counts of per-line integration items.
--- * `MiniMapSymbolLine` - scrollbar part representing current line.
--- * `MiniMapSymbolView` - scrollbar part representing current view.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.minimap_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.minimap_disable`
--- (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
--- and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
--- recipes.

--- # Mappings ~
---
--- This module doesn't make mappings, only provides functions for users to map
--- manually. Here is how one |<Leader>| set of mappings can be constructed: >
---
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mc', MiniMap.close)
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mf', MiniMap.toggle_focus)
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mo', MiniMap.open)
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mr', MiniMap.refresh)
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>ms', MiniMap.toggle_side)
---   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mt', MiniMap.toggle)
--- <
--- # How automatic refresh works ~
---
--- Automatic refresh is done by calling |MiniMap.refresh()| when appropriate
--- |events| occur. It is done with specially chosen `parts` argument value (to
--- avoid unnecessary computations). For example, when only cursor has moved
--- (|CursorMoved|), only scrollbar is updated; so no recomputation of integrations
--- or line encoding is done.
---
--- To avoid visual clutter, automatic refresh is done only in normal buffers
--- and help pages (i.e. with |buftype| being empty or "help")
---
--- When you think content is not up to date, try one of these:
--- - Call |MiniMap.refresh()| manually. Make mapping to make it easier.
--- - Save current buffer, for example with |:write|.
--- - Exit and enter Normal mode (if your Neovim version supports |ModeChanged|).
---@tag mini.map-usage

---@alias __map_opts table|nil Options used to define map configuration. Same structure

---@text # Options ~
---
--- ## Symbols ~
---
--- Options in `config.symbols` define characters used to display various
--- information in map window.
---
--- ### Encode symbols ~
---
--- The `config.symbols.encode` option defines which characters are used to
--- encode source buffer lines. For details of encode algorithm, see
--- |MiniMap.encode_strings()|.
---
--- This option should be a table with the following structure:
--- - <resolution> field - table containing <row> and <col> elements with row
---   and column resolution of each symbol. This defines encoding structure and
---   number of needed encode symbols.
--- - Numerical fields 1, 2, ..., 2^(row_resolution * col_resolution). Each symbol
---   represents a `(row_resolution, col_resolution)` boolean mask (`true` for
---   non-whitespace, `false` for whitespace), created as (reversed) binary digit:
---   `true` as 1; `false` as 0. Traversing left-right, top-bottom (top-left is
---   lowest bit, bottom-right - highest). So first symbol encodes a complete
---   whitespace, last - complete non-whitespace.
---
--- If `nil` (default), output of |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()| with `'3x2'`
--- identifier is used.
---
--- Example: { '1', '2', '3', '4', resolution = { row = 1, col = 2 } }. This
--- will encode two characters in each input row. So a string `'  a  aaa'` will
--- be encoded as `'1234'`.
---
--- There are pre-built generators of encode symbols:
--- - |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()|
--- - |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.dot()|
--- - |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.shade()|
---
--- ### Scrollbar symbols ~
---
--- Options `config.symbols.scroll_line` and `config.symbols.scroll_view` define
--- strings used to represent current line and current view inside map window.
--- Can have any length, map window content will adjust.
---
--- If supplied window width is small enough so that only (part of) of
--- scrollbar can be shown, it is called a "pure scrollbar". The behavior differs
--- slightly from normal map window. See "Pure scrollbar config" later section.
---
--- Some suggestions for scrollbar symbols:
--- - View-line pairs: '▒' and '█'.
--- - Line - '🮚', '▶'.
--- - View - '╎', '┋', '┋'.
---
--- ## Integrations ~
---
--- Option `config.integrations` is an array of integrations. Each one is used
--- to define map line highlights representing some important lines in source
--- buffer. If `nil` (default), no integrations are used.
---
--- Each integration should be a callable returning an array with data about
--- **source buffer** lines it wants to highlight. Each array element should be
--- a table with <line> (source buffer line number) and <hl_group> (string with
--- highlight group name) keys. Note: line number outside of source buffer
--- count will be converted to a nearest appropriate one.
---
--- Example output of single integration: >
---
---   {
---     { line = 1, hl_group = 'Search' },
---     { line = 2, hl_group = 'Operator' },
---     { line = 9, hl_group = 'Search'}
---   }
--- <
--- Conversion to map highlights is done on a "first seen" basis: actual
--- highlight group applied to a map line is taken from the first integration
--- output convertible to that map line. Other outputs with same map line
--- (after conversion) contribute to integration count shown between scrollbar
--- and encoded lines (if `config.window.show_integration_count` is `true`).
---
--- Previous example output with default `'3x2'` resolution will add |hl-Search|
--- highlight on map lines 1 and 3, and show integration count 2 on first line.
---
--- Every element of integrations array is called one by one from start to end
--- with their outputs appended to end of single array. This means that more
--- important integrations should be placed in the beginning of an array, as
--- this will make them have higher priority in case other integrations will
--- highlight same map line.
---
--- Example of using `config.integrations`: >
---
---   local map = require('mini.map')
---   map.setup({
---     integrations = {
---       map.gen_integration.builtin_search(),
---       map.gen_integration.gitsigns(),
---       map.gen_integration.diagnostic(),
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- ## Window config ~
---
--- Option `config.window` defines some properties of map window.
---
--- `window.focusable` - whether to allow focusing on map window with other
--- methods beside |MiniMap.toggle_focus()| (like |wincmd|, |CTRL-W|, or
--- mouse). Default: `false`.
---
--- `window.side` - which side to stick map window: `'left'` or `'right'` (default).
---
--- `window.show_integration_count` - whether to show integration count between
--- scrollbar and encoded lines. Integration count is a number of integration
--- outputs which were converted to same map line. When `true`, adds single
--- cell column with numbers from 2 to 9 and character '+' indicating count
--- greater than 9. Count 1 is not shown, because it is redundant to highlighted
--- map line. Default: `true`.
---
--- `window.width` - width of floating window, including scrollbar and
--- integration count column. Default: 10.
---
--- `window.winblend` - value of 'winblend' of floating window. Value 0 makes it
--- completely non-transparent, 100 - completely transparent (content is still
--- visible, but with slightly different highlights).
---
--- `window.zindex` - z-index of floating window. Default: 10.
---
--- # Pure scrollbar config ~
---
--- "Pure scrollbar" is a configuration when window width is not enough to show
--- encoded content. It has following differences from default "map" approach:
--- - It doesn't perform line encoding with |MiniMap.encode_strings()|
---   but instead uses encoding with fixed number of lines (equal to window
---   height).
--- - Integration highlights are not computed.
---
--- Config: >
---
---   require('mini.map').setup({
---     -- Customize `symbols` to your liking
---
---     window = {
---       -- Set this to the maximum width of your scroll symbols
---       width = 1,
---
---       -- Set this to your liking. Try values 0, 25, 50, 75, 100
---       winblend = 100,
---
---       -- Don't need extra column
---       show_integration_count = false,
---     }
---   })
MiniMap.config = {
  -- Highlight integrations (none by default)
  integrations = nil,

  -- Symbols used to display data
  symbols = {
    -- Encode symbols. See `:h MiniMap.config` for specification and
    -- `:h MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols` for pre-built ones.
    -- Default: solid blocks with 3x2 resolution.
    encode = nil,

    -- Scrollbar parts for view and line. Use empty string to disable any.
    scroll_line = '█',
    scroll_view = '┃',
  },

  -- Window options
  window = {
    -- Whether window is focusable in normal way (with `wincmd` or mouse)
    focusable = false,

    -- Side to stick ('left' or 'right')
    side = 'right',

    -- Whether to show count of multiple integration highlights
    show_integration_count = true,

    -- Total width
    width = 10,

    -- Value of 'winblend' option
    winblend = 25,

    -- Z-index
    zindex = 10,
  },
}
--minidoc_afterlines_end

--- Table with information about current state of map
---
--- At least these keys are supported:
--- - <buf_data> - table with buffer identifiers. Field <map> contains
---   identifier of a buffer used to display map. Field <source> - buffer
---   identifier which content map is displaying (i.e. source buffer).
--- - <win_data> - table of window identifiers used to display map in certain
---   tabpage. Keys: tabpage identifier. Values: window identifier.
--- - <opts> - current options used to control map display. Same structure
---   as |MiniMap.config|. Takes precedence over global and buffer-local configs.
---   Is reset when last map window is closed with |MiniMap.close()|.
MiniMap.current = {
  buf_data = {},
  win_data = {},
  opts = {},
}

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Encode strings
---
--- This takes arbitrary array of strings and computes its non-whitespace
--- outline. Output is an array of strings with configurable array length, string
--- width, and symbols representing encoding.
---
--- Each encode symbol is assumed to have resolution within which it can convey
--- binary information. For example, resolution `3x2` (row resolution 3,
--- column - 2) means that each symbol can encode 3 rows and 2 columns of
--- binary data. Here it is used to encode non-whitespace mask. See more in
--- "Encode symbols" section of |MiniMap.config|.
---
--- Encoding has the following steps:
--- - Convert strings to boolean mask: 2d boolean array with each row
---   representing a string. Element in every row subarray is `true` if
---   respective (possibly multibyte) character in a string is not a whitespace,
---   `false` otherwise. Note: tabs are expanded into 'tabstop' spaces.
--- - Rescale to appropriate dimensions:
---     - Each output dimension is just enough to encode all input strings, but
---       not more than supplied dimensions (`opts.n_rows * resolution.row` and
---       `opts.n_cols * resolution.col` respectively).
---     - If input dimensions are too big to fit inside output, perform grid
---       downscaling with loss of information. Input boolean mask is divided
---       into 2d-bins with as equal as possible dimensions. Each bin then
---       converted into single boolean value: `true` if bin contains at least
---       one `true` element, `false` otherwise. This leads to a whitespace
---       output meaning that **all** entries in a bin are whitespace, while
---       non-whitespace output means that **some** entry is non-whitespace.
--- - Convert boolean mask to symbol strings:
---     - Input rescaled boolean mask is divided into bins with dimensions of
---       symbol resolution (assuming `false` outer padding).
---     - Each bin with resolution dimensions is transformed into encode symbol.
---       Single convertible `(resolution.row, resolution.col)` boolean
---       mask is treated as (reversed) binary digit: `true` as 1; `false` as 0.
---       Traversing left-right, top-bottom (top-left is lowest bit,
---       bottom-right - highest).
---
--- Example ~
---
--- Assume the output should have 3 rows of symbols each with width 2. Encode
--- symbols are ' ', '▌', '▐', '█' with `1x2` resolution.
---
--- Assume input strings: >
---   aaaaa
---    b b
---
---    d d
---   e e
--- <
--- Steps:
--- - Convert to boolean mask (each row is a boolean array, "t"/"f" ~ `true`/`false`,
---   empty spots are equivalent to being `false`): >
---   ttttt
---   ftft
---
---   ftft
---   tft
--- <
--- - Rescale. Output dimensions are `n_rows * resolution.row = 3 * 1 = 3` rows and
---   `n_cols * resolution.col = 2 * 2 = 4`. It creates as equal as possible grid
---   with 3 rows and 4 columns and converts bins to single booleans. Result: >
---   tttt
---   tftf
---   ttff
--- - Convert to symbols. It makes `1x2` bins, treats their input as (reversed)
---   binary digits (`ff=00=0`, `tf=10=1`, `ft=01=2`, `tt=11=3`) and takes
---   corresponding symbols from supplied options (value plus 1). Result: >
---   ██
