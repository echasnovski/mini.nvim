--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Jump within visible lines via iterative label filtering.
---
--- Features:
--- - Make jump by iterative filtering of possible, equally considered jump
---   spots until there is only one. Filtering is done by typing a label
---   character that is visualized at jump spot.
---
--- - Customizable (see |MiniJump2d.config|):
---     - Way of computing possible jump spots with opinionated default.
---     - Characters used to label jump spots during iterative filtering.
---     - Visual effects: how many steps ahead to show; dim lines with spots.
---     - Action hooks to be executed at certain events during jump.
---     - Allowed windows: current and/or not current.
---     - Allowed lines: whether to process blank or folded lines, lines
---       before/at/after cursor line, etc. Example: user can configure to look
---       for spots only inside current window at or after cursor line.
---     Example: user can configure to look for word starts only inside current
---     window at or after cursor line with 'j' and 'k' labels performing some
---     action after jump.
---
--- - Works in Visual and Operator-pending (with dot-repeat) modes.
---
--- - Preconfigured ways of computing jump spots (see |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|).
---
--- - Works with multibyte characters.
---
--- General overview of how jump is intended to be performed:
--- - Lock eyes on desired location ("spot") recognizable by future jump.
---   Should be within visible lines at place where cursor can be placed.
---
--- - Initiate jump. Either by custom keybinding or with a call to
---   |MiniJump2d.start()| (allows customization options). This will highlight
---   all possible jump spots with their labels (letters from "a" to "z" by
---   default). For more details, read |MiniJump2d.start()| and |MiniJump2d.config|.
---
--- - Type character that appeared over desired location. If its label was
---   unique, jump is performed. If it wasn't unique, possible jump spots are
---   filtered to those having the same label character.
---
--- - Repeat previous step until there is only one possible jump spot or type `<CR>`
---   to jump to first available jump spot. Typing anything else stops jumping
---    without moving cursor.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.jump2d').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
--- `MiniJump2d` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
--- `:lua MiniJump2d.*`).
---
--- See |MiniJump2d.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minijump2d_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniJump2d.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Example usage ~
---
--- - Modify default jumping to use only current window at or after cursor line: >
---   require('mini.jump2d').setup({
---     allowed_lines = { cursor_before = false },
---     allowed_windows = { not_current = false },
---   })
--- - `lua MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.line_start)` - jump to word
---   start using combination of options supplied in |MiniJump2d.config| and
---   |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.line_start|.
--- - `lua MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.single_character)` - jump
---   to single character typed after executing this command.
--- - See more examples in |MiniJump2d.start| and |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'phaazon/hop.nvim':
---     - Both are fast, customizable, and extensible (user can write their own
---       ways to define jump spots).
---     - 'hop.nvim' visualizes all steps at once. While this module can show
---       configurable number of steps ahead.
---     - Both have several builtin ways to specify type of jump (word start,
---       line start, one character or query based on user input). 'hop.nvim'
---       does that by exporting many targeted Neovim commands, while this
---       module has preconfigured basic options leaving others to
---       customization with Lua code (see |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|).
---     - 'hop.nvim' computes labels (called "hints") differently. Contrary to
---       this module deliberately not having preference of one jump spot over
---       another, 'hop.nvim' uses specialized algorithm that produces sequence
---       of keys in a slightly biased manner: some sequences are intentionally
---       shorter than the others (leading to fewer average keystrokes). They
---       are put near cursor (by default) and highlighted differently. Final
---       order of sequences is based on distance to the cursor.
---     - 'mini.jump2d' has opinionated default algorithm of computing jump
---       spots. See |MiniJump2d.default_spotter|.
---
--- # Highlight groups ~
---
--- * `MiniJump2dSpot` - highlighting of jump spot's next step. By default it
---   uses label with highest contrast while not being too visually demanding:
---   white on black for dark 'background', black on white for light. If it
---   doesn't suit your liking, try couple of these alternatives (or choose
---   your own, of course):
---     - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=reverse` - reverse underlying highlighting (more
---       colorful while being visible in any colorscheme).
---     - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=bold,italic` - bold italic.
---     - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=undercurl guisp=red` - red undercurl.
---
--- * `MiniJump2dSpotUnique` - highlighting of jump spot's next step if it has
---   unique label. By default links to `MiniJump2dSpot`.
---
--- * `MiniJump2dSpotAhead` - highlighting of jump spot's future steps. By default
---   similar to `MiniJump2dSpot` but with less contrast and visibility.
---
--- * `MiniJump2dDim` - highlighting of lines with at least one jump spot.
---   Make it non-bright in order for jump spot labels to be more visible.
---   By default linked to `Comment` highlight group.
---
--- To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.minijump2d_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.minijump2d_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
--- number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
--- rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

---
--- ## Spotter function ~
---
--- Actual computation of possible jump spots is done through spotter function.
--- It should have the following arguments:
--- - `line_num` is a line number inside buffer.
--- - `args` - table with additional arguments:
---     - {win_id} - identifier of a window where input line number is from.
---     - {win_id_init} - identifier of a window which was current when
---       `MiniJump2d.start()` was called.
---
--- Its output is a list of byte-indexed positions that should be considered as
--- possible jump spots for this particular line in this particular window.
--- Note: for a more aligned visualization this list should be (but not
--- strictly necessary) sorted increasingly.
---
--- Note: spotter function is always called with `win_id` window being
--- "temporary current" (see |nvim_win_call|). This allows using builtin
--- Vimscript functions that operate only inside current window.
---
--- ## View ~
---
--- Option `view.n_steps_ahead` controls how many steps ahead to show along
--- with the currently required label. Those future steps are showed with
--- different (less visible) highlight group ("MiniJump2dSpotAhead"). Usually
--- it is a good idea to use this with a spotter which doesn't result into many
--- jump spots (like, for example, |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.word_start|).
--- Default is 0 to not show anything ahead as it reduces visual noise.
---
--- Option `view.dim` controls whether to dim lines with at least one jump spot.
--- Dimming is done by applying "MiniJump2dDim" highlight group to the whol line.
---
--- ## Allowed lines ~
---
--- Option `allowed_lines` controls which lines will be used for computing
--- possible jump spots:
--- - If `blank` or `fold` is `true`, it is possible to jump to first column of blank
---   line (determined by |prevnonblank|) or first folded one (determined by
---   |foldclosed|) respectively. Otherwise they are skipped. These lines are
---   not processed by spotter function even if the option is `true`.
--- - If `cursor_before`, (`cursor_at`, `cursor_after`) is `true`, lines before
---   (at, after) cursor line of all processed windows are forwarded to spotter
---   function. Otherwise, they don't. This allows control of jump "direction".
---
--- ## Hooks ~
---
--- Following hook functions can be used to further tweak jumping experience:
--- - `before_start` - called without arguments first thing when jump starts.
---   One of the possible use cases is to ask for user input and update spotter
---   function with it.
--- - `after_jump` - called after jump was actually done. Useful to make
---   post-adjustments (like move cursor to first non-whitespace character).

-- Module functionality =======================================================
--- Start jumping
---
--- Compute possible jump spots, visualize them and wait for iterative filtering.
---
--- First computation of possible jump spots ~
---
--- - Process allowed windows (current and/or not current; controlled by
---   `allowed_windows` option) by visible lines from top to bottom. For each
---   one see if it is allowed (controlled by `allowed_lines` option). If not
---   allowed, then do nothing. If allowed and should be processed by
---   `spotter`, process it.
--- - Apply spotter function from `spotter` option for each appropriate line
---   and concatenate outputs. This means that eventual order of jump spots
---   aligns with lexicographical order within "window id" - "line number" -
---   "position in `spotter` output" tuples.
--- - For each possible jump compute its label: a single character from
---   `labels` option used to filter jump spots. Each possible label character
---   might be used more than once to label several "consecutive" jump spots.
---   It is done in an optimal way under assumption of no preference of one
---   spot over another. Basically, it means "use all labels at each step of
---   iterative filtering as equally as possible".
---
--- Visualization ~
---
--- Current label for each possible jump spot is shown at that position
--- overriding everything underneath it.
---
--- Iterative filtering ~
---
--- Labels of possible jump spots are computed in order to use them as equally
--- as possible.
---
--- Example:
--- - With `abc` as `labels` option, initial labels for 10 possible jumps
---   are "aaaabbbccc". As there are 10 spots which should be "coded" with 3
---   symbols, at least 2 symbols need 3 steps to filter them out. With current
---   implementation those are always the "first ones".
--- - After typing `a`, it filters first four jump spots and recomputes its
---   labels to be "aabc".
--- - After typing `a` again, it filters first two spots and recomputes its
---   labels to be "ab".
--- - After typing either `a` or `b` it filters single spot and makes jump.
---
--- With default 26 labels for most real-world cases 2 steps is enough for
--- default spotter function. Rarely 3 steps are needed with several windows.
---
---@param opts table|nil Configuration of jumping, overriding global and buffer
---   local values.config|. Has the same structure as |MiniJump2d.config|
---   without <mappings> field. Extra allowed fields:
---     - <hl_group> - which highlight group to use for first step.
---       Default: "MiniJump2dSpot".
---     - <hl_group_ahead> - which highlight group to use for second step and later.
---       Default: "MiniJump2dSpotAhead".
---     - <hl_group_dim> - which highlight group to use dimming used lines.

--- Default spotter function

--- - Alphanumeric character followed or preceded by punctuation (useful for

--- - Start of uppercase character group (useful for camel case names). Usually
---   only Latin alphabet is recognized due to Lua patterns shortcomings.
---
--- These rules are derived in an attempt to balance between two intentions:
--- - Allow as much useful jumping spots as possible.
--- - Make labeled jump spots easily distinguishable.
---
--- Usually takes from 2 to 3 keystrokes to get to destination.
