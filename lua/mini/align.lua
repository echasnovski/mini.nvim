---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Rich and flexible customization of both alignment rules and user interaction.
--- Works with charwise, linewise, and blockwise selections in both Normal mode
--- (on textobject/motion; with dot-repeat) and Visual mode.
---
--- Features:
--- - Alignment is done in three main steps:
---     - <Split> lines into parts based on Lua pattern(s) or user-supplied rule.
---     - <Justify> parts for certain side(s) to be same width inside columns.
---     - <Merge> parts to be lines, with customizable delimiter(s).
---   Each main step can be preceded by other steps (pre-steps) to achieve
---   highly customizable outcome. See `steps` value in |MiniAlign.config|. For
---   more details, see |MiniAlign-glossary| and |MiniAlign-algorithm|.
---
--- - User can control alignment interactively by pressing customizable modifiers
---   (single keys representing how alignment steps and/or options should change).
---   Some of default modifiers:
---     - Press `s` to enter split Lua pattern.
---     - Press `j` to choose justification side from available ones ("left",
---       "center", "right", "none").
---     - Press `m` to enter merge delimiter.
---     - Press `f` to enter filter Lua expression to configure which parts
---       will be affected (like "align only first column").
---     - Press `i` to ignore some commonly unwanted split matches.
---     - Press `p` to pair neighboring parts so they be aligned together.
---     - Press `t` to trim whitespace from parts.
---     - Press `<BS>` (backspace) to delete some last pre-step.
---   For more details, see |MiniAlign-modifiers-builtin| and |MiniAlign-examples|.
---
--- - Alignment can be done with instant preview (result is updated after each
---   modifier) or without it (result is shown and accepted after non-default
---   split pattern is set).
---
--- - Every user interaction is accompanied with helper status message showing
---   relevant information about current alignment process.
---
--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.align').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniAlign`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniAlign.*`).
---
--- See |MiniAlign.config| for available config settings.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings (like `config.modifiers`) locally
--- to buffer inside `vim.b.minialign_config` which should have same structure
--- as `MiniAlign.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'junegunn/vim-easy-align':
---     - 'mini.align' is mostly designed after 'junegunn/vim-easy-align', so
---       there are a lot of similarities.
---     - Both plugins allow users to change alignment options interactively by
---       pressing modifier keys (albeit completely different default ones).
---       'junegunn/vim-easy-align' has those modifiers fixed, while 'mini.align'
---       allows their full customization. See |MiniAlign.config| for examples.
---     - 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' is designed to treat delimiters differently
---       than other parts of strings. 'mini.align' doesn't distinguish split
---       parts from one another by design: splitting is allowed to be done
---       based on some other logic than by splitting on delimiters.
---     - 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' initially aligns by only first delimiter.
---       'mini.align' initially aligns by all delimiter.
---     - 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' implements special filtering by delimiter
---       row number. 'mini.align' has builtin filtering based on Lua code
---       supplied by user in modifier phase. See |MiniAlign.gen_step.filter|
---       and 'f' builtin modifier.
---     - 'mini.align' treats any non-registered modifier as a plain delimiter
---       pattern, while 'junegunn/vim-easy-align' does not.
---     - 'mini.align' exports core Lua function used for aligning strings
---       (|MiniAlign.align_strings()|).
--- - 'godlygeek/tabular':
---     - 'godlygeek/tabular' is mostly designed around single command which is
---       customized by printing its parameters. 'mini.align' implements
---       different concept of interactive alignment through pressing
---       customizable single character modifiers.
---     - 'godlygeek/tabular' can detect region upon which alignment can be
---       desirable. 'mini.align' does not by design: use Visual selection or
---       textobject/motion to explicitly define region to align.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable, set `vim.g.minialign_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.minialign_disable`
--- (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
--- and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
--- functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
--- recipes.

---         Usually by concatenating rows into strings.
---
--- REGION  Table representing region in a buffer. Fields: <from> and <to> for

--- Algorithm design
---
--- There are two main processes implemented in 'mini.align': strings alignment
--- and interactive region alignment. See |MiniAlign-glossary| for more information
--- about used terms.
---
--- Strings alignment ~
---
--- Main implementation is in |MiniAlign.align_strings()|. Its input is array of
--- strings and output - array of aligned strings. The process consists from three
--- main steps (split, justify, merge) which can be preceded by any number of
--- preliminary steps (pre-split, pre-justify, pre-merge).
---
--- Algorithm:
--- - <Pre-split>. Take input array of strings and consecutively apply all
---   pre-split steps (`steps.pre_split`). Each one has `(strings, opts)` signature
---   and should modify array in place.
--- - <Split>. Take array of strings and convert it to parts with `steps.split()`.
---   It has `(strings, opts)` signature and should return parts.
--- - <Pre-justify>. Take parts and consecutively apply all pre-justify
---   steps (`steps.pre_justify`). Each one has `(parts, opts)` signature and
---   should modify parts in place.
--- - <Justify>. Take parts and apply `steps.justify()`. It has `(parts, opts)`
---   signature and should modify parts in place.
--- - <Pre-merge>. Take parts and consecutively apply all pre-merge
---   steps (`steps.pre_merge`). Each one has `(parts, opts)` signature and
---   should modify parts in place.
--- - <Merge>. Take parts and convert it to array of strings with `steps.merge()`.
---   It has `(parts, opts)` signature and should return array of strings.
---
--- Notes:
--- - All table objects are initially copied so that modification in place doesn't
---   affect workflow.
--- - Default main steps are designed to be controlled via options. See
---   |MiniAlign.align_strings()| and default step entries in |MiniAlign.gen_step|.
--- - All steps are guaranteed to take same option table as second argument.
---   This allows steps to "talk" to each other, i.e. earlier steps can pass data
---   to later ones.
---
--- Interactive region alignment ~
---
--- Interactive alignment is a main entry point for most users. It can be done
--- in two flavors:
--- - <Without preview>. Initiated via mapping defined in `start` of
---   `MiniAlign.config.mappings`. Alignment is accepted once split pattern becomes
---   non-default.
--- - <With preview>. Initiated via mapping defined in `start_with_preview` of
---   `MiniAlign.config.mappings`. Alignment result is shown after every modifier
---   and is accepted after `<CR>` (`Enter`) is hit. Note: each preview is done by
---   applying current alignment steps and options to the initial region lines,
---   not the ones currently displaying in preview.
---
--- Lifecycle (assuming default mappings):
--- - <Initiate alignment>:
---     - In Normal mode type `ga` (or `gA` to show preview) followed by textobject
---       or motion defining region to be aligned.
---     - In Visual mode select region and type `ga` (or `gA` to show preview).
---   Strings contained in selected region will be used as input to
---   |MiniAlign.align_strings()|.
---   Beware of mode when selecting region: charwise (`v`), linewise (`V`), or
---   blockwise (`<C-v>`). They all behave differently.
--- - <Press modifiers>. Press single keys one at a time:
---     - If pressed key is among table keys of `modifiers` table of
---       |MiniAlign.config|, its function value is executed. It usually modifies
---       some options(s) and/or affects some pre-step(s).
---     - If pressed key is not among defined modifiers, it is treated as plain
---       split pattern.
---   This process can either end by itself (usually in case of no preview and
---   non-default split pattern being set) or you can choose to end it manually.
--- - <Accept or discard>. In case of active preview, accept current result by
---   pressing `<CR>`. Discard any result and return to initial regions with
---   either `<Esc>` or `<C-c>`.
---
--- See more in |MiniAlign-modifiers-builtin| and |MiniAlign-examples|.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Visual blockwise selection works best with 'virtualedit' equal to "block"
---   or "all".
---@tag MiniAlign-algorithm

--- Overview of builtin modifiers
---
--- All examples assume interactive alignment with preview in linewise mode. With
--- default mappings, use `V` to select lines and `gA` to initiate alignment. It
--- might be helpful to copy lines into modifiable buffer and experiment yourself.
---
--- Notes:
--- - Any pressed key which doesn't have defined modifier will be treated as
---   plain split pattern.
--- - All modifiers can be customized inside |MiniAlign.setup|. See "Modifiers"
---   section of |MiniAlign.config|.
---
--- Main option modifiers ~
---
--- <s> Enter split pattern (confirm prompt by pressing `<CR>`). Input is treated
---     as plain delimiter.
---
---     Before: >
---     a-b-c
---     aa-bb-cc
--- <
---     After typing `s-<CR>`: >
---     a -b -c
---     aa-bb-cc
--- <
--- <j> Choose justify side. Prompts user (with helper message) to type single
---     character identifier of side: `l`eft, `c`enter, `r`ight, `n`one.
---
---     Before: >
---     a_b_c

---     a --_--b --_--c
---     aa--_--bb--_--cc
--- <
--- Modifiers adding pre-steps ~
---
--- <f> Enter filter expression. See more details in |MiniAlign.gen_step.filter()|.
---
---     Before: >
---     a_b_c
---     aa_bb_cc

--- <
---     After typing `_t` (first make split by `_`): >
---     a   _b _c
---       aa_bb_cc
--- <
--- Delete some last pre-step ~
---
--- <BS> Delete one of the pre-steps. If there is only one kind of pre-steps,
---      remove its latest added one. If not, prompt user to choose pre-step kind
---      by entering single character: `s`plit, `j`ustify, `m`erge.
---
---      Examples:
---      - `tp<BS>` results in only "trim" step to be left.
---      - `it<BS>` prompts to choose which step to delete (pre-split or
---        pre-justify in this case).
---
--- Special configurations for common splits ~
---
--- <=> Use special pattern to align by a group of consecutive "=". It can be
---     preceded by any number of punctuation marks and followed by some sommon
---     punctuation characters. Trim whitespace and merge with single space.
---
---     Before: >
---     a=b
---     aa<=bb
---     aaa===bbb
---     aaaa   =   cccc
--- <
---     After typing `=`: >
---     a    =   b
---     aa   <=  bb
---     aaa  === bbb
---     aaaa =   cccc
--- <
--- <,> Besides splitting by "," character, trim whitespace, pair neighboring
---     parts and merge with single space.
---
---     Before: >
---     a,b
---     aa,bb
---     aaa    ,    bbb
--- <
---     After typing `,`: >
---     a,   b
---     aa,  bb
---     aaa, bbb
--- <
--- < > (Space bar) Squash consecutive whitespace into single single space (accept
---     possible indentation) and split by `%s+` pattern (keeps indentation).
---
---     Before: >
---     a b c
---       aa    bb   cc
--- <
---     After typing `<Space>`: >
---       a  b  c
---       aa bb cc

---
--- ## Modifiers ~
---
--- `MiniAlign.config.modifiers` is used to define interactive user experience
--- of managing alignment process. It is a table with single character keys and
--- modifier function values.
---
--- Each modifier function:
--- - Is called when corresponding modifier key is pressed.
--- - Has signature `(steps, opts)` and should modify any of its input in place.
---
--- Examples:
--- - Modifier function used for default 'i' modifier: >
---
---   function(steps, _)
---     table.insert(steps.pre_split, MiniAlign.gen_step.ignore_split())
---   end
--- <
--- - Tweak 't' modifier to use highest indentation instead of keeping it: >
---
---   require('mini.align').setup({
---     modifiers = {
---       t = function(steps, _)
---         local trim_high = MiniAlign.gen_step.trim('both', 'high')
---         table.insert(steps.pre_justify, trim_high)
---       end
---     }
---   })
--- <
--- - Tweak `j` modifier to cycle through available "justify_side" option
---   values (like in 'junegunn/vim-easy-align'): >
---
---   require('mini.align').setup({
---     modifiers = {
---       j = function(_, opts)
---         local next_option = ({
---           left = 'center', center = 'right', right = 'none', none = 'left',
---         })[opts.justify_side]
---         opts.justify_side = next_option or 'left'
---       end,
---     },
---   })
--- <
--- ## Options ~
---
--- `MiniAlign.config.options` defines default values of options used to control
--- behavior of steps.
---
--- Examples:
--- - Set `justify_side = 'center'` to center align at initialization.
---
--- For more details about options see |MiniAlign.align_strings()| and entries of
--- |MiniAlign.gen_step| for default main steps.
---
--- ## Steps ~
---
--- `MiniAlign.config.steps` defines default steps to be applied during
--- alignment process.
---
--- Examples:
--- - Align by default only first pair of columns: >
---
---   local align = require('mini.align')
---   align.setup({
---     steps = {
---       pre_justify = { align.gen_step.filter('n == 1') }
---     },

--- Convert 2d array of strings to parts
---
--- This function verifies if input is a proper 2d array of strings and adds
--- methods to its copy.
---
---@class parts
---
---@field apply function Takes callable `f` and applies it to every part.
---   Callable should have signature `(s, data)`: `s` is a string part,
---   `data` - table with its data (<row> has row number, <col> has column number).
---   Returns new 2d array.
---
---@field apply_inplace function Takes callable `f` and applies it to every part.
---   Should have same signature as in `apply` method. Outputs (should all be
---   strings) are assigned in place to a corresponding parts element. Returns
---   parts itself to enable method chaining.
---
---@field get_dims function Return dimensions of parts array: a table with
---   <row> and <col> keys having number of rows and number of columns (maximum
---   number of elements across all rows).
---
---@field group function Concatenate neighboring strings based on supplied
---   boolean mask and direction (one of "left", default, or "right"). Has
---   signature `(mask, direction)` and modifies parts in place. Returns parts
---   itself to enable method chaining.
---   Example:
---   - Parts: { { "a", "b", "c" }, { "d", "e" }, { "f" } }
---   - Mask: { { false, false, true }, { true, false }, { false } }
---   - Result for direction "left":  { { "abc" },    { "d", "e" }, { "f" } }
---   - Result for direction "right": { { "ab","c" }, { "de" },     { "f" } }
---
---@field pair function Concatenate neighboring element pairs. Takes
---   `direction` as input (one of "left", default, or "right") and applies
---   `group()` for an alternating mask.
---   Example:
---   - Parts: { { "a", "b", "c" }, { "d", "e" }, { "f" } }
---   - Result for direction "left":  { { "ab", "c" }, { "de" }, { "f" } }
---   - Result for direction "right": { { "a", "bc" }, { "de" }, { "f" } }
---
---@field slice_col function Return column with input index `j`. Note: it might
---   not be an array if rows have unequal number of columns.
---
---@field slice_row function Return row with input index `i`.
---
---@field trim function Trim elements whitespace. Has signature `(direction, indent)`
---   and modifies parts in place. Returns parts itself to enable method chaining.
---   - Possible values of `direction`: "both" (default), "left", "right",
---   "none". Defines from which side whitespaces should be removed.
---   - Possible values of `indent`: "keep" (default), "low", "high", "remove".
---   Defines what to do with possible indent (left whitespace of first string
---   in a row). Value "keep" keeps it; "low" makes all indent equal to the
---   lowest across rows; "high" - highest across rows; "remove" - removes indent.

---
--- Outputs of elements named `default_*` are used as default corresponding main

---
--- Outputs of other elements depend on both step generator input values and

--- Generate default split step
---
--- Output splits strings using matches of Lua pattern(s) from `split_pattern`
--- option which are not dismissed by `split_exclude_patterns` option.
---
--- Outline of how single string is split:
--- - Convert `split_pattern` option to array of strings (string is converted
---   as one-element array). This array will be recycled in case there are more
---   split matches than in converted `split_pattern` array (which almost always).
--- - Find all forbidden spans (intervals inside string) - all matches of all
---   patterns in `split_exclude_patterns`.
--- - Find match for the next pattern. If it is not inside any forbidden span,
---   add preceding unmatched substring and matched split as two parts. Repeat
---   with the next pattern.
--- - If no pattern match is found, add the rest of string as final part.
---
--- Output uses following options (as part second argument, `opts` table):
--- - <split_pattern> - string or array of strings used to detect split matches
---   and create parts. Default: `''` meaning no matches (whole string is used
---   as part). Examples: `'%s+'`, `{ '<', '>' }`.
--- - <split_exclude_patterns> - array of strings defining which regions to
---   exclude from being matched. Default: `{}`. Examples: `{ '".-"', '^%s*#.*' }`.
---
---@return table A step named "split" and with appropriate callable action.
---
---@seealso |MiniAlign.gen_step.ignore_split()| heavily uses `split_exclude_patterns`.

--- Generate default justify step
---
--- Output makes column elements of string parts have equal width by adding
--- left and/or right whitespace padding. Which side(s) to pad is defined by
--- `justify_side` option. Width of first column can be tweaked with `justify_offsets`
--- option.
---
--- Outline of how parts are justified:
--- - Convert `justify_side` option to array of strings (single string is
---   converted as one-element array). Recycle this array to have length equal
---   to number of columns in parts.
--- - For all columns compute maximum width of strings from it (add offsets from
---   `justify_offsets` to first column widths). Note: for left alignment, width
---   of last row element does not affect column width. This is mainly because
---   it won't be padded and helps dealing with "no single match" lines.
--- - Make all elements have same width inside column by adding appropriate
---   amount of whitespace. Which side(s) to add is controlled by the corresponding
---   `justify_side` array element. Note: padding is done with spaces which
---   might conflict with tab indentation.
---
--- Output uses following options (as part second argument, `opts` table):
--- - <justify_side> - string or array of strings. Each element can be one of
---   "left" (pad right side), "center" (pad both sides equally), "right" (pad
---   left side), "none" (no padding). Default: "left".
--- - <justify_offsets> - array of numeric left offsets of rows. Used to adjust
---   for possible not equal indents, like in case of charwise selection when
---   left edge is not on the first column. Default: array of zeros. Set
---   automatically during interactive alignment in charwise mode.

--- Generate default merge step
---
--- Output merges rows of parts into strings by placing merge delimiter(s)
--- between them.
---

--- - Convert `merge_delimiter` option to array of strings (single string is
---   converted as one-element array). Recycle this array to have length equal
---   to number of columns in parts minus 1.
--- - Exclude empty strings from parts. They add nothing to output except extra
---   usage of merge delimiter.
--- - Concatenate each row interleaving with array of merge delimiters.
---
--- Output uses following options (as part second argument, `opts` table):
--- - <merge_delimiter> - string or array of strings. Default: `''`.
---   Examples: `' '`, `{ '', ' ' }`.
---
---@return table A step named "merge" and with appropriate callable action.
MiniAlign.gen_step.default_merge = function() return MiniAlign.new_step('merge', H.default_action_merge) end

--- Generate filter step
---
--- Construct function predicate from supplied Lua string expression and make
--- step evaluating it on every part element.
---
--- Outline of how filtering is done:
--- - Convert Lua filtering expression into function predicate which can be
---   evaluated in manually created context (some specific variables being set).
--- - Compute boolean mask for parts by applying predicate to each element of
---   2d array with special variables set to specific values (see next section).
--- - Group parts with compted mask. See `group()` method of parts in
---   |MiniAlign.as_parts()|.
---
--- Special variables which can be used in expression:
--- - <row> - row number of current element.
--- - <ROW> - total number of rows in parts.
--- - <col> - column number of current element.
--- - <COL> - total number of columns in current row.
--- - <s>   - string value of current element.
--- - <n>   - column pair number of current element. Useful when filtering by
---           result of pattern splitting.
--- - <N>   - total number of column pairs in current row.
--- - All variables from global table `_G`.
---
--- Tips:
--- - This general filtering approach can be used to both include and exclude
---   certain parts from alignment. Examples:
---     - Use `row ~= 2` to align all parts except from second row.
---     - Use `n == 1` to align only by first pair of columns.
--- - Filtering by last equal sign usually can be done with `n >= (N - 1)`
---   (because there is usually something to the right of it).
