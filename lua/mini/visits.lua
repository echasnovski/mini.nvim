--- *mini.visits* Track and reuse file system visits
--- *MiniVisits*

---
--- ==============================================================================
---
--- Features:
---
--- - Persistently track file system visits (both files and directories)
---   per project directory. Store visit index is human readable and editable.
---
--- - Visit index is normalized on every write to contain relevant information.
---   Exact details can be customized. See |MiniVisits.normalize()|.
---
--- - Built-in ability to persistently add labels to path for later use.
---   See |MiniVisits.add_label()| and |MiniVisits.remove_label()|.
---
--- - Exported functions to reuse visit data:
---     - List visited paths/labels with custom filter and sort (uses "robust
---       frecency" by default). Can be used as source for pickers.
---       See |MiniVisits.list_paths()| and |MiniVisits.list_labels()|.
---       See |MiniVisits.gen_filter| and |MiniVisits.gen_sort|.
---
---     - Select visited paths/labels using |vim.ui.select()|.
---       See |MiniVisits.select_path()| and |MiniVisits.select_labels()|.
---
---     - Iterate through visit paths in target direction ("forward", "backward",
---       "first", "last"). See |MiniVisits.iterate_paths()|.
---
--- - Exported functions to manually update visit index allowing persistent
---   track of any user information. See `*_index()` functions.
---
--- Notes:
--- - All data is stored _only_ in in-session Lua variable (for quick operation)
---   and at `config.store.path` on disk (for persistent usage).
--- - Most of functions affect an in-session data which gets written to disk only
---   before Neovim is closing or when users asks to.
--- - It doesn't account for paths being renamed or moved (because there is no
---   general way to detect that). Usually a manual intervention to the visit
---   index is required after the change but _before_ the next writing to disk
---   (usually before closing current session) because it will treat previous
---   path as deleted and remove it from index.
---   There is a |MiniVisits.rename_in_index()| helper for that.
---   If rename/move is done with |MiniFiles|, index is autoupdated.

--- # Setup ~
---
--- This module needs a setup with `require('mini.visits').setup({})` (replace
--- `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniVisits`
--- which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniVisits.*`).
---
--- See |MiniVisits.config| for `config` structure and default values.
---
--- You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
--- `vim.b.minivisits_config` which should have same structure as
--- `MiniVisits.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.
---
--- # Comparisons ~
---
--- - 'nvim-telescope/telescope-frecency.nvim':
---     - It stores array of actual visit timestamps, while this module tracks
---       only total number and latest timestamp of visits. This is by design
---       as a different trade-off between how much data is being used/stored
---       and complexity of underlying "frecency" sorting.
---     - By default tracks a buffer only once per session, while this module
---       tracks on every meaningful buffer enter. This leads to a more relevant
---       in-session sorting.
---     - Implements an original frecency algorithm of Firefox's address bar,
---       while this module uses own "robust frecency" approach.
---     - Mostly designed to work with 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim', while
---       this module provides general function to list paths and select
---       with |vim.ui.select()|.
---     - Does not allow use of custom data (like labels), while this module does.
---
--- - 'ThePrimeagen/harpoon':
---     - Has slightly different concept than general labeling, which more
---       resembles adding paths to an ordered stack. This module implements
---       a more common labeling which does not imply order with ability to
---       make it automated depending on the task and/or preference.
---     - Implements marks as positions in a path, while this module labels paths.
---     - Writes data on disk after every meaning change, while this module is
---       more conservative and read only when Neovim closes or when asked to.
---     - Has support for labeling terminals, while this modules is oriented
---       only towards paths.
---     - Has dedicated UI to manage marks, while this module does not by design.
---       There are functions for adding and removing label from the path.
---     - Does not provide functionality to track and reuse any visited path,
---       while this module does.
---
--- # Disabling ~
---
--- To disable automated tracking, set `vim.g.minivisits_disable` (globally) or
--- `vim.b.minivisits_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
--- number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
--- rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
--- |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

--- # Tracking visits ~
---
--- File system visits (both directory and files) tracking is done in two steps:
--- - On every dedicated event (`config.track.event`, |BufEnter| by default) timer
---   is (re)started to actually register visit after certain amount of time
---   (`config.track.delay` milliseconds, 1000 by default). It is not registered
---   immediately to allow navigation to target buffer in several steps
---   (for example, with series of |:bnext| / |:bprevious|).
---
--- - When delay time passes without any dedicated events being triggered
---   (meaning user is "settled" on certain buffer), |MiniVisits.register_visit()|
---   is called if all of the following conditions are met:
---     - Module is not disabled (see "Disabling" section in |MiniVisits|).
---     - Buffer is normal with non-empty name (used as visit path).
---     - Visit path does not equal to the latest tracked one. This is to allow
---       temporary enter of non-normal buffers (like help, terminal, etc.)
---       without artificial increase of visit count.
---
--- Visit is autoregistered for |current-directory| and leads to increase of count
--- and latest time of visit. See |MiniVisits-index-specification| for more details.
---
--- Notes:
--- - All data is stored _only_ in in-session Lua variable (for quick operation)
---   and at `config.store.path` on disk (for persistent usage). It is automatically
---   written to disk before every Neovim exit (if `config.store.autowrite` is set).
---
--- - Tracking can be disabled by supplying empty string as `track.event`.
---   Then it is up to the user to properly call |MiniVisits.register_visit()|.
---
--- # Reusing visits ~
---
--- Visit data can be reused in at least these ways:
---
--- - Get a list of visited paths (see |MiniVisits.list_paths()|) and use it
---   to visualize/pick/navigate visit history.
---
--- - Select one of the visited paths to open it (see |MiniVisits.select_path()|).
---
--- - Move along visit history (see |MiniVisits.iterate_paths()|).
---
--- - Utilize labels. Any visit can be added one or more labels (like "core",
---   "tmp", etc.). They are bound to the visit (path registered for certain
---   directory) and are stored persistently.
---   Labels can be used to manually create groups of files and/or directories
---   that have particular interest to the user.
---   There is no one right way to use them, though. See |MiniVisits-examples|
---   for some inspiration.
---
--- - Utilizing custom data. Visit index can be manipulated manually using
---   `_index()` set of functions. All "storable" (i.e. not functions or
---   metatables) user data inside index is then stored on disk, so it can be
---   used to create any kind of workflow user wants.
---
--- See |MiniVisits-examples| for some actual configuration and workflow examples.
---@tag MiniVisits-overview

--- # Structure ~
---
--- Visit index is a table containing actual data in two level deep nested tables.
---
--- First level keys are paths of project directory (a.k.a "cwd") for which
--- visits are registered.
---
--- Second level keys are actual visit paths. Their values are tables with visit
--- data which should follow these requirements:
--- - Field <count> should be present and be a number. It represents the number
---   of times this path was visited under particular cwd.
--- - Field <latest> should be present and be a number. It represents the time
---   of latest path visit under particular cwd.
---   By default computed with |os.time()| (up to a second).
--- - Field <labels> might not be present. If present, it should be a table
---   with string labels as keys and `true` as values. It represents labels of
---   the path under particular cwd.
---
--- Notes:
--- - All paths are absolute.
--- - Visit path should not necessarily be a part of corresponding cwd.
--- - Both `count` and `latest` can be any number: whole, fractional, negative, etc.
---
--- Example of an index data: >
---
---   {
---     ['/home/user/project_1'] = {
---       ['home/user/project_1/file'] = { count = 3, latest = 1699796000 },
---       ['home/user/project_1/subdir'] = {
---         count = 10, latest = 1699797000, labels = { core = true },
---       },
---     },
---     ['/home/user/project_2'] = {
---       ['home/user/project_1/file'] = {
---         count = 0, latest = 0, labels = { other = true },
---       },
---       ['home/user/project_2/README'] = { count = 1, latest = 1699798000 },
---     },
---   }
--- <
--- # Storage ~
---
--- When stored on disk, visit index is a file containing Lua code returning
--- visit index table. It can be edited by hand as long as it contains a valid
--- Lua code (to be executed with |dofile()|).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Storage is implemented in such a way that it doesn't really support more
---   than one parallel Neovim processes. Meaning that if there are two or more
---   simultaneous Neovim processes with same visit index storage path, the last
---   one writing to it will preserve its visit history while others - won't.
---
--- # Normalization ~
---
--- To ensure that visit index contains mostly relevant data, it gets normalized:
--- automatically inside |MiniVisits.write_index()| or via |MiniVisits.normalize()|.
---
--- What normalization actually does can be configured in `config.store.normalize`.
---
--- See |MiniVisits.gen_normalize.default()| for default normalization approach.
---@tag MiniVisits-index-specification

--- # Workflow examples ~
---
--- This module provides a flexible framework for working with file system visits.
--- Exact choice of how to organize workflow is left to the user.
--- Here are some examples for inspiration which can be combined together.
---
--- ## Use different sorting ~
---
--- Default sorting in |MiniVisits.gen_sort.default()| allows flexible adjustment
--- of which feature to prefer more: recency or frequency. Here is an example of
--- how to make set of keymaps for three types of sorting combined with two types
--- of scopes (all visits and only for current cwd): >
---
---   local make_select_path = function(select_global, recency_weight)
---     local visits = require('mini.visits')
---     local sort = visits.gen_sort.default({ recency_weight = recency_weight })
---     local select_opts = { sort = sort }
---     return function()
---       local cwd = select_global and '' or vim.fn.getcwd()
---       visits.select_path(cwd, select_opts)
---     end
---   end
---
---   local map = function(lhs, desc, ...)
---     vim.keymap.set('n', lhs, make_select_path(...), { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   -- Adjust LHS and description to your liking
---   map('<Leader>vr', 'Select recent (all)',   true,  1)
---   map('<Leader>vR', 'Select recent (cwd)',   false, 1)
---   map('<Leader>vy', 'Select frecent (all)',  true,  0.5)
---   map('<Leader>vY', 'Select frecent (cwd)',  false, 0.5)
---   map('<Leader>vf', 'Select frequent (all)', true,  0)
---   map('<Leader>vF', 'Select frequent (cwd)', false, 0)
--- <
---
--- Note: If you have |MiniPick|, consider using |MiniExtra.pickers.visit_paths()|.
---
--- ## Use manual labels ~
---
--- Labels is a powerful tool to create groups of associated paths.
--- Usual workflow consists of:
--- - Add label with |MiniVisits.add_label()| (prompts for actual label).
--- - Remove label with |MiniVisits.remove_label()| (prompts for actual label).
--- - When need to use labeled groups, call |MiniVisits.select_label()| which
---   will then call |MiniVisits.select_path()| to select path among those
---   having selected label.
---   Note: If you have |MiniPick|, consider using |MiniExtra.pickers.visit_labels()|.
---
--- To make this workflow smoother, here is an example of keymaps: >
---
---   local map_vis = function(keys, call, desc)
---     local rhs = '<Cmd>lua MiniVisits.' .. call .. '<CR>'
---     vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>' .. keys, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   map_vis('vv', 'add_label()',          'Add label')
---   map_vis('vV', 'remove_label()',       'Remove label')
---   map_vis('vl', 'select_label("", "")', 'Select label (all)')
---   map_vis('vL', 'select_label()',       'Select label (cwd)')
--- <
--- ## Use fixed labels ~
---
--- During work on every project there is usually a handful of files where core
--- activity is concentrated. This can be made easier by creating mappings
--- which add/remove special fixed label (for example, "core") and select paths
--- with that label for both all and current cwd. Example: >
---
---   -- Create and select
---   local map_vis = function(keys, call, desc)
---     local rhs = '<Cmd>lua MiniVisits.' .. call .. '<CR>'
---     vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>' .. keys, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   map_vis('vv', 'add_label("core")',                     'Add to core')
---   map_vis('vV', 'remove_label("core")',                  'Remove from core')
---   map_vis('vc', 'select_path("", { filter = "core" })',  'Select core (all)')
---   map_vis('vC', 'select_path(nil, { filter = "core" })', 'Select core (cwd)')
---
---   -- Iterate based on recency
---   local map_iterate_core = function(lhs, direction, desc)
---     local opts = { filter = 'core', sort = sort_latest, wrap = true }
---     local rhs = function()
---       MiniVisits.iterate_paths(direction, vim.fn.getcwd(), opts)
---     end
---     vim.keymap.set('n', lhs, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   map_iterate_core('[{', 'last',     'Core label (earliest)')
---   map_iterate_core('[[', 'forward',  'Core label (earlier)')
---   map_iterate_core(']]', 'backward', 'Core label (later)')
---   map_iterate_core(']}', 'first',    'Core label (latest)')
--- <
--- ## Use automated labels ~
---
--- When using version control system (such as Git), usually there is already
--- an identifier that groups files you are working with - branch name.
--- Here is an example of keymaps to add/remove label equal to branch name: >
---
---   local map_branch = function(keys, action, desc)
---     local rhs = function()
---       local branch = vim.fn.system('git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD')
---       if vim.v.shell_error ~= 0 then return nil end
---       branch = vim.trim(branch)
---       require('mini.visits')[action](branch)
---     end
---     vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>' .. keys, rhs, { desc = desc })
---   end
---
---   map_branch('vb', 'add_label',    'Add branch label')
---   map_branch('vB', 'remove_label', 'Remove branch label')

--- # List ~
---
--- `config.list` defines how visit index is converted to a path list by default.
---
--- `list.filter` is a callable which should take a path data and return `true` if
--- this path should be present in the list.
--- Default: output of |MiniVisits.gen_filter.default()|.
---
--- Path data is a table with at least these fields:
--- - <path> `(string)` - absolute path of visit.
--- - <count> `(number)` - number of visits.
--- - <latest> `(number)` - timestamp of latest visit.
--- - <labels> `(table|nil)` - table of labels (has string keys with `true` values).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Both `count` and `latest` (in theory) can be any number. But built-in tracking
---   results into positive integer `count` and `latest` coming from |os.time()|.
--- - There can be other entries if they are set by user as index entry.
---
--- `list.sort` is a callable which should take an array of path data and return
--- a sorted array of path data (or at least tables each containing <path> field).
--- Default: output of |MiniVisits.get_sort.default()|.
--- Single path data entry is a table with a same structure as for `list.filter`.
---
--- Note, that `list.sort` can be used both to filter, sort, or even return paths
--- unrelated to the input.
---
--- # Silent ~
---
--- `config.silent` is a boolean controlling whether to show non-error feedback
--- (like adding/removing labels, etc.). Default: `false`.
---
--- # Store ~
---
--- `config.store` defines how visit index is stored on disk to enable persistent
--- data across several sessions.
---
--- `store.autowrite` is a boolean controlling whether to write visit data to
--- disk on |VimLeavePre| event. Default: `true`.
---
--- `store.normalize` is a callable which should take visit index
--- (see |MiniVisits-index-specification|) as input and return "normalized" visit
--- index as output. This is used to ensure that visit index is up to date and
--- contains only relevant data. For example, it controls how old and
--- irrelevant visits are "forgotten", and more.
--- Default: output of |MiniVisits.gen_normalize.default()|.
---
--- `store.path` is a path to which visit index is written. See "Storage" section
--- of |MiniVisits-index-specification| for more details.
--- Note: set to empty string to disable any writing with not explicitly set
--- path (including the one on |VimLeavePre|).
--- Default: "mini-visits-index" file inside |$XDG_DATA_HOME|.
---
--- # Track ~
---
--- `config.track` defines how visits are tracked (index entry is autoupdated).
--- See "Tracking visits" section in |MiniVisits-overview| for more details.
---
--- `track.event` is a proper Neovim |{event}| on which track get triggered.
--- Note: set to empty string to disable automated tracking.
--- Default: |BufEnter|.
---
--- `track.delay` is a delay in milliseconds after event is triggered and visit
--- is autoregistered.
--- Default: 1000 (to allow navigation between buffers without tracking
--- intermediate ones).

--- Iterate visit paths
---
--- Steps:
--- - Compute a sorted array of target paths using |MiniVisits.list_paths()|.
--- - Identify the current index inside the array based on path of current buffer.
--- - Iterate through the array certain amount of times in a dedicated direction:
---     - For "first" direction - forward starting from index 0 (so that single
---       first iteration leads to first path).
---     - For "backward" direction - backward starting from current index.
---     - For "forward" direction - forward starting from current index.
---     - For "last" direction - backward starting from index after the last one
---       (so that single first iteration leads to the last path).
---
--- Notes:
--- - Mostly designed to be used as a mapping. See `MiniVisits-examples`.
--- - If path from current buffer is not in the output of `MiniVisits.list_paths()`,
---   starting index is inferred such that first iteration lands on first item
---   (if iterating forward) or last item (if iterating backward).
--- - Navigation with this function is not tracked (see |MiniVisits-overview|).
---   This is done to allow consecutive application without affecting
---   underlying list of paths.
---
--- Examples assuming underlying array of files `{ "file1", "file2", "file3" }`:
---
--- - `MiniVisits("first")` results into focusing on "file1".
--- - `MiniVisits("backward", { n_times = 2 })` from "file3" results into "file1".
--- - `MiniVisits("forward", { n_times = 10 })` from "file1" results into "file3".
--- - `MiniVisits("last", { n_times = 4, wrap = true })` results into "file3".
---
---@param direction string One of "first", "backward", "forward", "last".
---@param cwd string|nil Forwarded to |MiniVisits.list_paths()|.

---   local new_index = MiniVisits.rename_in_index(path_from, path_to)

--- <
---@param path_from string Full path to be renamed.

--- Generate sort function
---
--- This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get specification.
MiniVisits.gen_sort = {}

--- Default sort
---
--- Sort paths using "robust frecency" approach. It relies on the rank operation:
--- based on certain reference number for every item, assign it a number
--- between 1 (best) and number of items (worst). Ties are dealt with "average
--- rank" approach: each element with a same reference number is assigned
--- an average rank among such elements. This way total rank sum depends only
--- on number of paths.
---
--- Here is an algorithm outline:
--- - Rank paths based on frequency (`count` value): from most to least frequent.
--- - Rank paths based on recency (`latest` value): from most to least recent.
--- - Combine ranks from previous steps with weights:
---   `score = (1 - w) * rank_frequency + w * rank_recency`, where `w` is
---   "recency weight". The smaller this weight the less recency affects outcome.
---
--- Examples:
--- - Default recency weight 0.5 results into "robust frecency" sorting: it
---   combines both frequency and recency.
---   This is called a "robust frecency" because actual values don't have direct
---   effect on the outcome, only ordering matters. For example, if there is
---   a very frequent file with `count = 100` while all others have `count = 5`,
---   it will not massively dominate the outcome as long as it is not very recent.
---
--- - Having recency weight 1 results into "from most to least recent" sorting.
---
--- - Having recency weight 0 results into "from most to least frequent" sorting.
---
---@param opts table|nil Option. Possible fields:
---   - <recency_weight> `(number)` - a number between 0 and 1 for recency weight.
---     Default: 0.5.
---
---@return function Visit sort function. See |MiniVisits.config.list| for more details.

--- Generate normalize function
---
--- This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get specification.
MiniVisits.gen_normalize = {}

--- Generate default normalize function
---
--- Steps:
--- - Prune visits, i.e. remove outdated visits:
---     - If `count` number of visits is below prune threshold, remove that visit
---       entry from particular cwd (it can still be present in others).
---     - If either first (cwd) or second (path) level key doesn't represent an
---       actual path on disk, remove the whole associated value.
---     - NOTE: if visit has any label, it is not automatically pruned.
---
--- - Decay visits, i.e. possibly make visits more outdated. This is an important
---   part to the whole usability: together with pruning it results into automated
---   removing of paths which were visited long ago and are not relevant.
---
---   Decay is done per cwd if its total `count` values sum exceeds decay threshold.
---   It is performed through multiplying each `count` by same coefficient so that
---   the new total sum of `count` is equal to some smaller target value.
---   Note: only two decimal places are preserved, so the sum might not be exact.
---
--- - Prune once more to ensure that there are no outdated paths after decay.
---
---@param opts table|nil Options. Possible fields:
---   - <decay_threshold> `(number)` - decay threshold. Default: 1000.
---   - <decay_target> `(number)` - decay target. Default: 800.
