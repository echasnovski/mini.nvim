Collection of minimal, independent, and fast Lua modules dedicated to improve [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) (version 0.5 and higher) experience. Think about it as "Swiss Army knife" among Neovim plugins: it has many different independent tools (modules) suitable for most common tasks. Each module can be used as a separate sub-plugin without any startup and usage overhead.

If you want to help this project grow but don't know where to start, check out [contributing guides](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

This plugin offers two branches to install from:

- `main` (default) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

There are at least the following ways to install this plugin:

- Using [wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

  ```lua
  -- Development
  use 'echasnovski/mini.nvim'

  -- Stable
  use { 'echasnovski/mini.nvim', branch = 'stable' }
  ```

- Using [junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

  ```vim
  " Development
  Plug 'echasnovski/mini.nvim'

  " Stable
  Plug 'echasnovski/mini.nvim', { 'branch': 'stable' }
  ```

- Each module is independent and implemented within single file. You can copy corresponding file from 'lua/mini/' directory to your '.config/nvim/lua' directory and use it from there.

Don't forget to call module's `setup()` (if required) to enable its functionality.

## General principles

- **Design**. Each module is designed to solve a particular problem targeting balance between feature-richness (handling as many edge-cases as possible) and simplicity of implementation/support. Granted, not all of them ended up with the same balance, but it is the goal nevertheless.
- **Independence**. Modules are independent of each other and can be run without external dependencies. Although some of them may need dependencies for full experience.
- **Structure**. Each module is a submodule for a placeholder "mini" module. So, for example, "surround" module should be referred to as "mini.surround". As later will be explained, this plugin can also be referred to as "MiniSurround".
- **Setup**:
  - Each module (if needed) should be setup separately with `require(<name of module>).setup({})` (possibly replace {} with your config table or omit to use defaults). You can supply only values which differ from defaults, which will be used for the rest ones.
  - Call to module's `setup()` always creates a global Lua object with coherent camel-case name: `require('mini.surround').setup()` creates `_G.MiniSurround`. This allows for a simpler usage of plugin functionality: instead of `require('mini.surround')` use `MiniSurround` (or manually `:lua MiniSurround.*` in command line); available from `v:lua` like `v:lua.MiniSurround`. Considering this, "module" and "Lua object" names can be used interchangeably: 'mini.surround' and 'MiniSurround' will mean the same thing.
  - Each supplied `config` table (aft) is stored in `config` field of global object. Like `MiniSurround.config`.
  - Values of `config`, which affect runtime activity, can be changed on the fly to have effect. For example, `MiniSurround.config.n_lines` can be changed during runtime; but changing `MiniSurround.config.mappings` won't have any effect (as mappings are created once during `setup()`).
- **Disabling**. Each module's core functionality can be disabled globally or buffer-locally by creating appropriate global or buffer-scoped variables equal to `v:true`. See `mini.nvim-disabling-recipes` section in help file for common recipes.
- **Highlight groups**. Appearance of module's output is controlled by certain highlight group (see `:h highlight-groups`). To customize them, use `highlight` command. **Note**: currently not many Neovim themes support this plugin's highlight groups; fixing this situation is highly appreciated. To see a more calibrated look, use MiniBase16 or plugin's colorscheme `minischeme`.
- **Stability**. Each module upon release is considered to be relatively stable: both in terms of setup and functionality. Any non-bugfix backward-incompatible change will be released gradually as much as possible.

## Plugin colorscheme

This plugin comes with an official colorscheme named `minischeme`. This is a MiniBase16 theme created with faster version of the following Lua code: `require('mini.base16').setup({palette = palette, name = 'minischeme', use_cterm = true})` where `palette` is:

- For dark 'background': `require('mini.base16').mini_palette('#112641', '#e2e98f', 75)`
- For light 'background': `require('mini.base16').mini_palette('#e2e5ca', '#002a83', 75)`

Activate it as a regular `colorscheme`.

All examples use this colorscheme.

## Modules

### mini.base16

  },

  -- Fallback action. It will always be run in Insert mode. To use Neovim's
  -- built-in completion (see `:h ins-completion`), supply its mapping as
  -- string. Example: to use 'whole lines' completion, supply '<C-x><C-l>'.
  fallback_action = --<function: like `<C-n>` completion>,

  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one. Some of them
  -- might conflict with system mappings.
  mappings = {
    force_twostep = '<C-Space>', -- Force two-step completion
    force_fallback = '<A-Space>', -- Force fallback completion

## Planned modules

This is the list of modules I currently intend to implement eventually (as my free time and dedication will allow):

- 'mini.align' - fast text alignment. Something like [tommcdo/vim-lion](https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-lion).
- 'mini.terminal' (or 'mini.repl') - coherently manage terminal windows and send text from buffers to terminal windows. Something like [kassio/neoterm](https://github.com/kassio/neoterm).
- 'mini.exchange' (or 'mini.swap') - exchange two regions of text. Something like [tommcdo/vim-exchange](https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-exchange).
- 'mini.arguments' - work with listed arguments. Something like [FooSoft/vim-argwrap](https://github.com/FooSoft/vim-argwrap) and [AndrewRadev/sideways.vim](https://github.com/AndrewRadev/sideways.vim).
- 'mini.tree' - file tree explorer. Truncated version of [kyazdani42/nvim-tree](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-tree.lua).
