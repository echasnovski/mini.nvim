*mini.completion* Completion and signature help
*MiniCompletion*

==============================================================================

Key design ideas:
- Have an async (with customizable "debounce" delay) "two-stage chain
  completion": first try to get completion items from LSP client (if set
  up) and if no result, fallback to custom action.

- Managing completion is done as much with Neovim's built-in tools as
  possible.

Features:
- Two-stage chain completion:
    - First stage is an LSP completion implemented via
      |MiniCompletion.completefunc_lsp()|. It should be set up as either
      |completefunc| or |omnifunc|. It tries to get completion items from
      LSP client (via 'textDocument/completion' request). Custom
      preprocessing of response items is possible (with
      `MiniCompletion.config.lsp_completion.process_items`), for example
      with fuzzy matching. By default items which are not snippets and
      directly start with completed word are kept and sorted according to
      LSP specification. Supports `additionalTextEdits`, like auto-import
      and others (see 'Notes').
    - If first stage is not set up or resulted into no candidates, fallback
      action is executed. The most tested actions are Neovim's built-in
      insert completion (see |ins-completion|).

- Automatic display in floating window of completion item info (via
  'completionItem/resolve' request) and signature help (with highlighting
  of active parameter if LSP server provides such information). After
  opening, window for signature help is fixed and is closed when there is
  nothing to show, text is different or
  when leaving Insert mode.

- Automatic actions are done after some configurable amount of delay. This
  reduces computational load and allows fast typing (completion and
  signature help) and item selection (item info)

- User can force two-stage completion via
  |MiniCompletion.complete_twostage()| (by default is mapped to
  `<C-Space>`) or fallback completion via
  |MiniCompletion.complete_fallback()| (mapped to `<M-Space>`).

What it doesn't do:
- Snippet expansion.
- Many configurable sources.
- Automatic mapping of `<CR>`, `<Tab>`, etc., as those tend to have highly
  variable user expectations. See 'Helpful key mappings' for suggestions.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.completion').setup({})`
(replace `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
`MiniCompletion` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
`:lua MiniCompletion.*`).

See |MiniCompletion.config| for `config` structure and default values.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minicompletion_config` which should have same structure as
`MiniCompletion.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Notes ~

- More appropriate, albeit slightly advanced, LSP completion setup is to set
  it not on every `BufEnter` event (default), but on every attach of LSP
  client. To do that:
    - Use in initial config:
    `lsp_completion = {source_func = 'omnifunc', auto_setup = false}`.
    - In `on_attach()` of every LSP client set 'omnifunc' option to exactly
      `v:lua.MiniCompletion.completefunc_lsp`.
- If you have trouble using custom (overridden) |vim.ui.input| (like from
  'stevearc/dressing.nvim'), make automated disable of 'mini.completion'
  for input buffer. For example, currently for 'dressing.nvim' it can be
  with `au FileType DressingInput lua vim.b.minicompletion_disable = true`.
- Support of `additionalTextEdits` tries to handle both types of servers:
    - When `additionalTextEdits` are supplied in response to
      'textDocument/completion' request (like currently in 'pyright').
    - When `additionalTextEdits` are supplied in response to
      'completionItem/resolve' request (like currently in
      'typescript-language-server'). In this case to apply edits user needs
      to trigger such request, i.e. select completion item and wait for
      `MiniCompletion.config.delay.info` time plus server response time.

# Comparisons ~

- 'nvim-cmp':
    - More complex design which allows multiple sources each in form of
      separate plugin. `MiniCompletion` has two built in: LSP and fallback.
    - Supports snippet expansion.
    - Doesn't have customizable delays for basic actions.
    - Doesn't allow fallback action.
    - Doesn't provide signature help.

# Helpful key mappings ~

To use `<Tab>` and `<S-Tab>` for navigation through completion list, make
these key mappings:
`vim.keymap.set('i', '<Tab>',   [[pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"]],   { expr = true })`
`vim.keymap.set('i', '<S-Tab>', [[pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"]], { expr = true })`

To get more consistent behavior of `<CR>`, you can use this template in
your 'init.lua' to make customized mapping: >
  local keys = {
    ['cr']        = vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes('<CR>', true, true, true),
    ['ctrl-y']    = vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes('<C-y>', true, true, true),
    ['ctrl-y_cr'] = vim.api.nvim_replace_termcodes('<C-y><CR>', true, true, true),
  }

  _G.cr_action = function()
    if vim.fn.pumvisible() ~= 0 then
      -- If popup is visible, confirm selected item or add new line otherwise
      local item_selected = vim.fn.complete_info()['selected'] ~= -1
      return item_selected and keys['ctrl-y'] or keys['ctrl-y_cr']
    else
      -- If popup is not visible, use plain `<CR>`. You might want to customize
      -- according to other plugins. For example, to use 'mini.pairs', replace
      -- next line with `return require('mini.pairs').cr()`
      return keys['cr']
    end
  end

  vim.keymap.set('i', '<CR>', 'v:lua._G.cr_action()', { expr = true })

# Highlight groups ~

* `MiniCompletionActiveParameter` - highlighting of signature active parameter.
  By default displayed as plain underline.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling ~

To disable, set `vim.g.minicompletion_disable` (globally) or
`vim.b.minicompletion_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
|mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

Default values:

  MiniCompletion.config = {
    -- Delay (debounce type, in ms) between certain Neovim event and action.
    -- This can be used to (virtually) disable certain automatic actions by
    -- setting very high delay time (like 10^7).
    delay = { completion = 100, info = 100, signature = 50 },

    -- Configuration for action windows:
    -- - `height` and `width` are maximum dimensions.
    -- - `border` defines border (as in `nvim_open_win()`).

      -- `process_items` should be a function which takes LSP
      -- 'textDocument/completion' response items and word to complete. Its
      -- output should be a table of the same nature as input items. The most
      -- common use-cases are custom filtering and sorting. You can use

      process_items = --<function: filters out snippets; sorts by LSP specs>,
    },

    -- Fallback action. It will always be run in Insert mode. To use Neovim's

    -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one. Some of them
    -- might conflict with system mappings.
