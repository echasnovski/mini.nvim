*mini.doc* Generate Neovim help files
*MiniDoc*

==============================================================================

Key design ideas:
- Keep documentation next to code by writing EmmyLua-like annotation
  comments. They will be parsed as is, so formatting should follow built-in
  guide in |help-writing|. However, custom hooks are allowed at many
  generation stages for more granular management of output help file.

- Generation is done by processing a set of ordered files line by line.
  Each line can either be considered as a part of documentation block (if
  it matches certain configurable pattern) or not (considered to be an
  "afterline" of documentation block). See |MiniDoc.generate()| for more
  details.

- Processing is done by using nested data structures (section, block, file,
  doc) describing certain parts of help file. See |MiniDoc-data-structures|
  for more details.

- Project specific script can be written as plain Lua file with
  configuratble path. See |MiniDoc.generate()| for more details.

What it doesn't do:
- It doesn't support markdown or other markup language inside annotations.
- It doesn't use treesitter in favor of Lua string manipulation for basic
  tasks (parsing annotations, formatting, auto-generating tags, etc.). This
  is done to manage complexity and be dependency free.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.doc').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniDoc`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniDoc.*`).

See |MiniDoc.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minidoc_config` which should have same structure as `MiniDoc.config`.
See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.

# Tips ~

- Some settings tips that might make writing annotation comments easier:
    - Set up appropriate 'comments' for `lua` file type to respect
      EmmyLua-like's `---` comment leader. Value `:---,:--` seems to work.
    - Set up appropriate 'formatoptions' (see also |fo-table|). Consider
      adding `j`, `n`, `q`, and `r` flags.
    - Set up appropriate 'formatlistpat' to help auto-formatting lists (if
      `n` flag is added to 'formatoptions'). One suggestion (not entirely
      ideal) is a value `^\s*[0-9\-\+\*]\+[\.\)]*\s\+`. This reads as 'at
      least one special character (digit, `-`, `+`, `*`) possibly followed
      by some punctuation (`.` or `)`) followed by at least one space is a
      start of list item'.
- Probably one of the most reliable resources for what is considered to be
  best practice when using this module is this whole plugin. Look at source
  code for the reference.

# Comparisons ~

- 'tjdevries/tree-sitter-lua':
    - Its key design is to use treesitter grammar to parse both Lua code
      and annotation comments. This makes it not easy to install,
      customize, and support.
    - It takes more care about automating output formatting (like auto
      indentation and line width fit). This plugin leans more to manual
      formatting with option to supply customized post-processing hooks.

                                                       *MiniDoc-data-structures*
Data structures

Data structures are basically arrays of other structures accompanied with
some fields (keys with data values) and methods (keys with function
values):
- `Section structure` is an array of string lines describing one aspect
  (determined by section id like '@param', '@return', '@text') of an
  annotation subject. All lines will be used directly in help file.
- `Block structure` is an array of sections describing one annotation
  subject like function, table, concept.
- `File structure` is an array of blocks describing certain file on disk.
  Basically, file is split into consecutive blocks: annotation lines go
  inside block, non-annotation - inside `block_afterlines` element of info.
- `Doc structure` is an array of files describing a final help file. Each
  string line from section (when traversed in depth-first fashion) goes
  directly into output file.

All structures have these keys:
- Fields:
    - `info` - contains additional information about current structure.
      For more details see next section.
    - `parent` - table of parent structure (if exists).
    - `parent_index` - index of this structure in its parent's array. Useful
      for adding to parent another structure near current one.
    - `type` - string with structure type (section, block, file, doc).
- Methods (use them as `x:method(args)`):
    - `insert(self, [index,] child)` - insert `child` to `self` at position
      `index` (optional; if not supplied, child will be appended to end).
      Basically, a `table.insert()`, but adds `parent` and `parent_index`
      fields to `child` while properly updating `self`.
    - `remove(self [,index])` - remove from `self` element at position
      `index`. Basically, a `table.remove()`, but properly updates `self`.
    - `has_descendant(self, predicate)` - whether there is a descendant
      (structure or string) for which `predicate` returns `true`. In case of
      success also returns the first such descendant as second value.
    - `has_lines(self)` - whether structure has any lines (even empty ones)
      to be put in output file. For section structures this is equivalent to
      `#self`, but more useful for higher order structures.
    - `clear_lines(self)` - remove all lines from structure. As a result,
      this structure won't contribute to output help file.

Description of `info` fields per structure type:
- `Section`:
    - `id` - captured section identifier. Can be empty string meaning no
      identifier is captured.
    - `line_begin` - line number inside file at which section begins (-1 if
      not generated from file).
    - `line_end` - line number inside file at which section ends (-1 if not
      generated from file).
- `Block`:
    - `afterlines` - array of strings which were parsed from file after
      this annotation block (up until the next block or end of file).
      Useful for making automated decisions about what is being documented.
    - `line_begin` - line number inside file at which block begins  (-1 if
      not generated from file).
    - `line_end` - line number inside file at which block ends  (-1 if not
      generated from file).
- `File`:
    - `path` - absolute path to a file (`''` if not generated from file).
- `Doc`:
    - `input` - array of input file paths (as in |MiniDoc.generate|).
    - `output` - output path (as in |MiniDoc.generate|).
    - `config` - configuration used (as in |MiniDoc.generate|).

# Notes ~

- `annotation_extractor` takes single string line as input. Output
  describes what makes an input to be an annotation (if anything). It
  should be similar to `string.find` with one capture group: start and end
  of annotation indicator (whole part will be removed from help line) with
  third value being string of section id (if input describes first line of
  section; `nil` or empty string otherwise). Output should be `nil` if line
  is not part of annotation.
  Default value means that annotation line should:
    - Start with `---` at first column.
    - Any non-whitespace after `---` will be treated as new section id.
    - Single whitespace at the start of main text will be ignored.
- Hooks are expected to be functions. Their default values might do many
  things which might change over time, so for more information please look
  at source code. Some more information can be found in
  |MiniDoc.default_hooks|.

                                                               *MiniDoc.current*
                               `MiniDoc.current`
Table with information about current state of auto-generation

It is reset at the beginning and end of `MiniDoc.generate()`.

At least these keys are supported:
- {aliases} - table with keys being alias name and values - alias
  description and single string (using `\n` to separate lines).
- {eval_section} - input section of `@eval` section hook. Can be used for
  information about current block, etc.
- {toc} - array with table of contents entries. Each entry is a whole
  `@toc_entry` section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *MiniDoc.default_hooks*
                            `MiniDoc.default_hooks`
Default hooks

This is default value of `MiniDoc.config.hooks`. Use it if only a little
tweak is needed.

Some more insight about their behavior:
- Default inference of documented object metadata (tag and object signature
  at the moment) is done in `block_pre`. Inference is based on string
  pattern matching, so can lead to false results, although works in most
  cases. It intentionally works only if first line after block has no
  indentation and contains all necessary information to determine if
  inference should happen.
- Hooks for sections describing some "variable-like" object ('@class',
  '@field', '@param') automatically enclose first word in '{}'.
- Hooks for sections which supposed to have "type-like" data ('@field',
  '@param', '@return', '@type') automatically enclose *first found*
  "type-like" word and its neighbor characters in '`(<type>)`' (expect
  false positives). Algorithm is far from being 100% correct, but seems to
  work with present allowed type annotation. For allowed types see
  https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/wiki/EmmyLua-Annotations#types-and-type
  or, better yet, look in source code of this module.
- Automated creation of table of contents (TOC) is done in the following way:
    - Put section with `@toc_entry` id in the annotation block. Section's
      lines will be registered as TOC entry.
    - Put `@toc` section where you want to insert rendered table of
      contents. TOC entries will be inserted on the left, references for
      their respective tag section (only first, if present) on the right.
      Render is done in default `doc` hook (because it should be done after
      processing all files).
- The `write_post` hook executes some actions convenient for iterative
  annotations writing:
    - Generate `:helptags` for directory containing output file.
    - Silently reload buffer containing output file (if such exists).
    - Display notification message about result.

                                                            *MiniDoc.generate()*
                `MiniDoc.generate`({input}, {output}, {config})
Generate help file

# Algorithm ~

- Main parameters for help generation are an array of input file paths and
  path to output help file.
- Parse all inputs:
  - For each file, lines are processed top to bottom in order to create an
    array of documentation blocks. Each line is tested whether it is an
    annotation by applying `MiniDoc.config.annotation_extractor`: if
    anything is extracted, it is considered to be an annotation. Annotation
    line goes to "current block" after removing extracted annotation
    indicator, otherwise - to afterlines of "current block".
  - Each block's annotation lines are processed top to bottom. If line had
    captured section id, it is a first line of "current section" (first
    block lines are allowed to not specify section id; by default it is
    `@text`). All subsequent lines without captured section id go into
    "current section".
- Apply structure hooks (they should modify its input in place, which is
  possible due to 'table nature' of all inputs):
    - Each block is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.block_pre`. This is a
      designated step for auto-generation of sections from described
      annotation subject (like sections with id `@tag`, `@type`).
    - Each section is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.section_pre`.
    - Each section is processed by corresponding
      `MiniDoc.config.hooks.sections` function (table key equals to section
      id). This is a step where most of formatting should happen (like
      wrap first word of `@param` section with `{` and `}`, append empty
      line to section, etc.).
    - Each section is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.section_post`.
    - Each block is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.block_post`. This is
      a step for processing block after formatting is done (like add first
      line with `----` delimiter).
    - Each file is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.file`. This is a step
      for adding any file-related data (like add first line with `====`
      delimiter).
    - Doc is processed by `MiniDoc.config.hooks.doc`. This is a step for
      adding any helpfile-related data (maybe like table of contents).
- Collect all strings from sections in depth-first fashion (equivalent to
  nested "for all files -> for all blocks -> for all sections -> for all
  strings -> add string to output"). Strings can have `\n` character
  indicating start of new line.
- Modify collected strings with `MiniDoc.config.write_pre`. Takes strings
  from previous step as input and should return array of strings.
- Write modified strings to output file.
- Execute `MiniDoc.config.write_post` hook. This is useful for showing some
  feedback and making actions involving newly updated help file (like
  generate tags, etc.).

# Project specific script ~

If all arguments have default `nil` values, first there is an attempt to
source project specific script. This is basically a `luafile
<MiniDoc.config.script_path>` with current Lua runtime while caching and
restoring current `MiniDoc.config`. Its successful execution stops any
further generation actions while error means proceeding generation as if no
script was found.

Typical script content might include definition of custom hooks, input and
output files with eventual call to `require('mini.doc').generate()` (with
or without arguments).

Parameters ~
{input} `(table|nil)` Array of file paths which will be processed in supplied
  order. Default: all '.lua' files from current directory following by all
  such files in these subdirectories: 'lua/', 'after/', 'colors/'. Note:
  any 'init.lua' file is placed before other files from the same directory.
{output} `(string|nil)` Path for output help file. Default:
  `doc/<current_directory>.txt` (designed to be used for generating help
  file for plugin).
{config} `(table|nil)` Configuration overriding parts of |MiniDoc.config|.

Return ~
`(table)` Document structure which was generated and used for output
  help file. In case `MiniDoc.config.script_path` was successfully used,
  this is a return from the latest call of this function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code()*
                     `MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code`({struct})
Convert afterlines to code

This function is designed to be used together with `@eval` section to
automate documentation of certain values (notable default values of a
table). It processes afterlines based on certain directives and makes
output looking like a code block.

Most common usage is by adding the following section in your annotation:
`@eval return MiniDoc.afterlines_to_code(MiniDoc.current.eval_section)`

# Directives ~
Directives are special comments that are processed using Lua string pattern
capabilities (so beware of false positives). Each directive should be put
on its separate line. Supported directives:
- `--minidoc_afterlines_end` denotes a line at afterlines end. Only all
  lines before it will be considered as afterlines. Useful if there is
  extra code in afterlines which shouldn't be used.
- `--minidoc_replace_start <replacement>` and `--minidoc_replace_end`
  denote lines between them which should be replaced with `<replacement>`.
  Useful for manually changing what should be placed in output like in case
  of replacing function body with something else.

Here is an example. Suppose having these afterlines:
>
  --minidoc_replace_start {
  M.config = {
    --minidoc_replace_end
    param_one = 1,
    --minidoc_replace_start param_fun = --<function>
    param_fun = function(x)
      return x + 1
    end
    --minidoc_replace_end
  }
  --minidoc_afterlines_end

  return M
<

After adding `@eval` section those will be formatted as:
>
  {
    param_one = 1,
    param_fun = --<function>
  }
<
Parameters ~
{struct} `(table)` Block or section structure which after lines will be
  converted to code.

Return ~
`(string|nil)` Single string (using `\n` to separate lines) describing
  afterlines as code block in help file. If `nil`, input is not valid.
