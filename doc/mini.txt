                                                                     *mini.nvim*

|mini.nvim| is a collection of minimal, independent, and fast Lua modules
dedicated to improve Neovim (version 0.5 and higher) experience. Each module
can be considered as a separate sub-plugin.

# General principles

- <Design>. Each module is designed to solve a particular problem targeting 
  balance between feature-richness (handling as many edge-cases as possible)
  and simplicity of implementation/support. Granted, not all of them ended up
  with the same balance, but it is the goal nevertheless.
- <Independence>. Modules are independent of each other and can be run without
  external dependencies. Although some of them may need dependencies for full
  experience.
- <Structure>. Each module is a submodule for a placeholder "mini" module. So, 
  for example, "surround" module should be referred to as "mini.surround". As
  later will be explained, this plugin can also be referred to as
  "MiniSurround".
- <Setup>:
    - Each module (if needed) should be setup separately with
      `require(<name of module>).setup({})` (possibly replace {} with your
      config table or omit to use defaults). You can supply only values which
      differ from defaults, which will be used for the rest ones.
    - Call to module's `setup()` always creates a global Lua object with 
      coherent camel-case name: `require('mini.suround').setup()` creates 
      `_G.MiniSurround`. This allows for a simpler usage of plugin 
      functionality: instead of `require('mini.surround')` use `MiniSurround`;
      available from |v:lua| with `v:lua.MiniSurround`. Considering this,
      "module" and "Lua object" names can be used interchangeably:
      'mini.surround' and 'MiniSurround' will mean the same thing.
    - Each supplied `config` table (after extending with default values) is 
      stored in `config` field of global object. Like `MiniSurround.config`.
    - Values of `config`, which affect runtime activity, can be changed on the
      fly to have effect. For example, `MiniSurround.config.n_lines` can be
      changed during runtime; but changing `MiniSurround.config.mappings` won't
      have any effect (as mappings are created once during `setup()`).
- <Disabling>. Each module's core functionality can be disabled globally or 
  buffer-locally by creating appropriate global or buffer-scoped variables with
  |v:true| value. For example:
    - To disable `MiniSurround` globally run `:let g:minisurround_disable=v:true`.
    - To disable `MiniSurround` for current buffer run `:let b:minisurround_disable=v:true`.
    - To toggle `MiniSurround` globally (disable if enabled, enable if
      disabled) use of Lua is more appropriate:
      `:lua vim.g.minisurround_disable = not vim.g.minisurround_disable`.
- <Highlight groups>. Appearance of module's output is controlled by certain
  highlight group (see |highlight-groups|). To customize them, use |highlight|
  command. Note: currently not many Neovim themes support this plugin's
  highlight groups; fixing this situation is highly appreciated. To see a more
  calibrated look, use |MiniBase16| or plugin's colorscheme `minischeme`.
- <Stability>. Each module upon release is considered to be relatively stable:
  both in terms of setup and functionality. Any non-bugfix
  backward-incompatible change will be released gradually as much as possible.

# List of modules

- |MiniBase16| - fast implementation of base16 theme for manually supplied 
  palette. Has unique palette generator which needs only background and 
  foreground colors.
- |MiniBufremove| - buffer removing (unshow, delete, wipeout) while saving 
  window layout.
- |MiniComment| - fast and familiar per-line code commenting.
- |MiniCompletion| - async (with customizable 'debounce' delay) 'two-stage 
  chain completion': first builtin LSP, then configurable fallback. Also has
  functionality for completion item info and function signature (both in
  floating window appearing after customizable delay).
- |MiniCursorword| - automatic highlighting of word under cursor (displayed 
  after customizable delay).
- |MiniFuzzy| - functions for fast and simple fuzzy matching. It has not only
  functions to perform fuzzy matching of one string to others, but also a
  sorter for |telescope.nvim|.
- |MiniMisc| - collection of miscellaneous useful functions. Like `put()` and
  `put_text()` which print Lua objects to command line and current buffer
  respectively.
- |MiniPairs| - autopairs plugin which has minimal defaults and functionality
  to do per-key expression mappings.
- |MiniStatusline| - minimal and fast statusline. Has ability to use custom 
  content supplied with concise function (using module's provided section 
  functions) along with builtin default. For full experience needs [Nerd 
  font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), 
  [gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) plugin, and 
  [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons) plugin
  (but works without any them).
- |MiniSurround| - fast surround plugin. Add, delete, replace, find, highlight
  surrounding (like pair of parenthesis, quotes, etc.). Has special "function
  call", "tag", and "interactive" surroundings. Supports dot-repeatability,
  textobject, motions.
- |MiniTabline| - minimal tabline which shows listed (see 'buflisted') buffers
  in case of one tab and falls back to default otherwise. For full experience
  needs [nvim-web-devicons](https://github.com/kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons).
- |MiniTrailspace| - automatic highlighting of trailing whitespace with 
  functionality to remove it.

# Plugin colorscheme

This plugin comes with an official colorscheme named `minischeme`. This is a
|MiniBase16| theme created with faster version of the following Lua code:
`require('mini.base16').setup({palette = palette, name = 'minischeme',
use_cterm = true})` where `palette` is:
- For dark 'background': `require('mini.base16').mini_palette('#112641',
  '#e2e98f', 75)`
- For light 'background': `require('mini.base16').mini_palette('#e2e5ca',
  '#002a83', 75)`

Activate it as a regular |colorscheme|.


================================================================================
                                                      *MiniBase16* *mini.base16*

Custom minimal and fast Lua module which implements
[base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) color scheme (with Copyright
(C) 2012 Chris Kempson) adapated for modern Neovim 0.5 Lua plugins. Extra
features:
- Configurable automatic support of cterm colors (see |highlight-cterm|).
- Opinionated palette generator based only on background and foreground colors.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.base16').setup({})` (replace `{}`
with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Table with names from `base00` to `base0F` and values being strings of HEX
  -- colors with format "#RRGGBB". NOTE: this should be explicitly supplied in
  -- `setup()`.
  palette = nil,

 -- Whether to support cterm colors. Can be boolean, `nil` (same as `false`),
 -- or table with cterm colors. See `setup()` documentation for more
 -- information.
  use_cterm = nil,
}

Example:

`require('mini.base16').setup({`
  `palette = {`
    `base00 = '#112641',`
    `base01 = '#3a475e',`
    `base02 = '#606b81',`
    `base03 = '#8691a7',`
    `base04 = '#d5dc81',`
    `base05 = '#e2e98f',`
    `base06 = '#eff69c',`
    `base07 = '#fcffaa',`
    `base08 = '#ffcfa0',`
    `base09 = '#cc7e46',`
    `base0A = '#46a436',`
    `base0B = '#9ff895',`
    `base0C = '#ca6ecf',`
    `base0D = '#42f7ff',`
    `base0E = '#ffc4ff',`
    `base0F = '#00a5c5',`
  `},`
  `use_cterm = true,`
`})`

# Notes
1. This module is used for creating plugin's official colorscheme named 
   `minischeme` (see |mini.nvim|).
2. Using `setup()` doesn't actually create a |colorscheme|. It basically 
   creates a coordinated set of |highlight|s. To create your own theme:
    - Put "myscheme.lua" file (name after your chosen theme name) inside any
      "colors" directory reachable from 'runtimepath' ("colors" inside your
      Neovim config directory is usually enough).
    - Inside "myscheme.lua" call `require('mini.base16').setup()` with your 
      palette and only after that set |g:colors_name| to "myscheme".


MiniBase16.setup({config})                                *MiniBase16.setup()*
    Module setup

    Setup is done by applying base16 palette to enable colorscheme. Highlight
    groups make an extended set from original
    [base16-vim](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim/) plugin. It is a
    good idea to have `config.palette` respect the original [styling
    principles](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16/blob/master/styling.md).

    By default only 'gui highlighting' (see |highlight-gui| and
    |termguicolors|) is supported. To support 'cterm highlighting' (see
    |highlight-cterm|) supply `config.use_cterm` argument in one of the
    formats:
    - `true` to auto-generate from `palette` (as closest colors).
    - Table with similar structure to `palette` but having terminal colors 
      (integers from 0 to 255) instead of hex strings.



    Parameters: ~
        {config} (table)  Module config table.

    Usage: ~
        `require('mini.base16').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your `config`
        table; `config.palette` should be a table with colors)


MiniBase16.mini_palette({background}, {foreground}, {accent_chroma}) *MiniBase16.mini_palette()*
    Create 'mini' palette

    Create base16 palette based on the HEX (string '#RRGGBB') colors of main
    background and foreground with optional setting of accent chroma (see
    details).

    # Algorithm design
    - Main operating color space is 
      [CIELCh(uv)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV#Cylindrical_representation_(CIELCh))
      which is a cylindrical representation of a perceptually uniform CIELUV 
      color space. It defines color by three values: lightness L (values from 0
      to 100), chroma (positive values), and hue (circular values from 0 to 360
      degress). Useful converting tool: https://www.easyrgb.com/en/convert.php
    - There are four important lightness values: background, foreground, focus 
      (around the middle of background and foreground, leaning towards 
      foreground), and edge (extreme lightness closest to foreground).
    - First four colors have the same chroma and hue as `background` but 
      lightness progresses from background towards focus.
    - Second four colors have the same chroma and hue as `foreground` but 
      lightness progresses from foreground towards edge in such a way that 
      'base05' color is main foreground color.
    - The rest eight colors are accent colors which are created in pairs
        - Each pair has same hue from set of hues 'most different' to 
          background and foreground hues (if respective chorma is positive).
        - All colors have the same chroma equal to `accent_chroma` (if not 
          provided, chroma of foreground is used, as they will appear next to
          each other). Note: this means that in case of low foreground chroma,
          it is a good idea to set `accent_chroma` manually. Values from 30
          (low chorma) to 80 (high chroma) are common.
        - Within pair there is base lightness (equal to foreground lightness)
          and alternative (equal to focus lightness). Base lightness goes to
          colors which will be used more frequently in code: base08
          (variables), base0B (strings), base0D (functions), base0E (keywords).
          How exactly accent colors are mapped to base16 palette is a result of
          trial and error. One rule of thumb was: colors within one hue pair
          should be more often seen next to each other. This is because it is
          easier to distinguish them and seems to be more visually appealing.
          That is why `base0D` and `base0F` have same hues because they usually
          represent functions and delimiter (brackets included).



    Parameters: ~
        {background}    (string)  Background HEX color (formatted as
                                  `#RRGGBB`).
        {foreground}    (string)  Foreground HEX color (formatted as
                                  `#RRGGBB`).
        {accent_chroma} (number)  Optional positive number (usually between 0
                                  and 100). Default: chroma of foreground
                                  color.

    Return: ~
        table: Table with base16 palette.

    Usage: ~
        `local palette = require('mini.base16').mini_palette('#112641',
        '#e2e98f', 75)`
        `require('mini.base16').setup({palette = palette})`


MiniBase16.rgb_palette_to_cterm_palette({palette}) *MiniBase16.rgb_palette_to_cterm_palette()*
    Converts palette with RGB colors to terminal colors

    Useful for caching `use_cterm` variable to increase speed.



    Parameters: ~
        {palette} (table)  Table with base16 palette (same as in
                           `MiniBase16.config.palette`).

    Return: ~
        table: Table with base16 palette using |highlight-cterm|.

                                                *MiniBufremove* *mini.bufremove*

Lua module for minimal buffer removing (unshow, delete, wipeout), which saves
window layout (opposite to builtin Neovim's commands). This is mostly a Lua
implementation of
[bclose.vim](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Deleting_a_buffer_without_closing_the_window).
Other alternatives:
- [vim-bbye](https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye)
- [vim-sayonara](https://github.com/mhinz/vim-sayonara)

# Setup

This module doesn't need setup, but it can be done to improve usability. Setup
with `require('mini.bufremove').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your `config`
table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Whether to set Vim's settings for buffers (allow hidden buffers)
  set_vim_settings = true,
}

# Notes
1. Which buffer to show in window(s) after its current buffer is removed is 
   decided by the algorithm:
   - If alternate buffer (see |CTRL-^|) is listed (see |buflisted()|), use it.
   - If previous listed buffer (see |bprevious|) is different, use it.
   - Otherwise create a scratch one with `nvim_create_buf(true, true)` and use 
     it.

# Disabling

To disable core functionality, set `g:minibufremove_disable` (globally) or
`b:minibufremove_disable` (for a buffer) to `v:true`.

MiniBufremove.setup({config})                          *MiniBufremove.setup()*
    Module setup



    Parameters: ~
        {config} (table)  Module config table.

    Usage: ~
        `require('mini.bufremove').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your `config`
        table)


MiniBufremove.delete({buf_id}, {force})               *MiniBufremove.delete()*
    Delete buffer `buf_id` with |:bdelete| after unshowing it.



    Parameters: ~
        {buf_id} (number)   Buffer identifier (see |bufnr()|) to use. Default:
                            0 for current.
        {force}  (boolean)  Whether to ignore unsaved changes (using `!`
                            version of command). Default: `false`.

    Return: ~
        boolean: Whether operation was successful.


MiniBufremove.wipeout({buf_id}, {force})             *MiniBufremove.wipeout()*
    Wipeout buffer `buf_id` with |:bwipeout| after unshowing it.



    Parameters: ~
        {buf_id} (number)   Buffer identifier (see |bufnr()|) to use. Default:
                            0 for current.
        {force}  (boolean)  Whether to ignore unsaved changes (using `!`
                            version of command). Default: `false`.

    Return: ~
        boolean: Whether operation was successful.


MiniBufremove.unshow({buf_id})                        *MiniBufremove.unshow()*
    Stop showing buffer `buf_id` in all windows



    Parameters: ~
        {buf_id} (number)  Buffer identifier (see |bufnr()|) to use. Default:
                           0 for current.

    Return: ~
        boolean: Whether operation was successful.


MiniBufremove.unshow_in_window({win_id})    *MiniBufremove.unshow_in_window()*
    Stop showing current buffer of window `win_id`


    Parameters: ~
        {win_id} (number)  Window identifier (see |win_getid()|) to use.
                           Default: 0 for current.

    Return: ~
        boolean: Whether operation was successful.



================================================================================
                                                    *MiniComment* *mini.comment*

Custom minimal and fast Lua module for code commenting. This is basically a
reimplementation of "tpope/vim-commentary". Commenting in Normal mode respects
|count| and is dot-repeatable. Comment structure is inferred from
'commentstring'.

What it doesn't do:
- Block and sub-line comments. This will only support per-line commenting.
- Configurable (from module) comment structure. Modify |commentstring| instead.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.comment').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    -- Toggle comment (like `gcip` - comment inner paragraph) for both
    -- Normal and Visual modes
    comment = 'gc',

    -- Toggle comment on current line
    comment_line = 'gcc',

    -- Define 'comment' textobject (like `dgc` - delete whole comment block)
    textobject = 'gc',
  }
}

# Disabling To disable core functionality, set `g:minicomment_disable`
(globally) or - `b:minicomment_disable` (for a buffer) to `v:true`.

MiniComment.setup({config})                              *MiniComment.setup()*
    Module setup



    Parameters: ~
        {config} (table)  Module config table.

    Usage: ~
        `require('mini.comment').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your `config`
        table)


MiniComment.operator({mode})                          *MiniComment.operator()*
    Main function to be mapped

    It is meant to be used in expression mappings (see |map-<expr>|) to enable
    dot-repeatability and commenting on range. There is no need to do this
    manually, everything is done inside |MiniComment.setup()|.

    It has a somewhat unintuitive logic (because of how expression mapping with
    dot-repeatability works): it should be called without arguments inside
    expression mapping and with argument when action should be performed.



    Parameters: ~
        {mode} (string)  Optional string with 'operatorfunc' mode (see |g@|).

    Return: ~
        string: 'g@' if called without argument, '' otherwise (but after
        performing action).


MiniComment.toggle_lines({line_start}, {line_end}) *MiniComment.toggle_lines()*
    Toggle comments between two line numbers

    It uncomments if lines are comment (every line is a comment) and comments
    otherwise. It respects indentation and doesn't insert trailing whitespace.
    Toggle commenting not in visual mode is also dot-repeatable and respects
    |count|.

    # Notes
    1. Currently call to this function will remove marks inside written range. 
       Use |lockmarks| to preserve marks.



    Parameters: ~
        {line_start} (number)  Start line number.
        {line_end}   (number)  End line number.


MiniComment.textobject()                            *MiniComment.textobject()*
    Comment textobject This selects all commented lines adjacent to cursor line
    (if it itself is commented). Designed to be used with operator mode
    mappings (see |mapmode-o|).




================================================================================
                                              *MiniCompletion* *mini.completion*

Custom somewhat minimal autocompletion Lua plugin. Key design ideas:
- Have an async (with customizable 'debounce' delay) 'two-stage chain 
  completion': first try to get completion items from LSP client (if set up)
  and if no result, fallback to custom action.
- Managing completion is done as much with Neovim's built-in tools as possible.

Features:
- Two-stage chain completion:
    - First stage is an LSP completion implemented via 
      |MiniCompletion.completefunc_lsp()|. It should be set up as either 
      |completefunc| or |omnifunc|. It tries to get completion items from LSP
      client (via 'textDocument/completion' request). Custom preprocessing of 
      response items is possible (with 
      `MiniCompletion.config.lsp_completion.process_items`), for example with
      fuzzy matching. By default items which are not snippets and directly
      start with completed word are kept and sorted according to LSP
      specification.
    - If first stage is not set up or resulted into no candidates, fallback 
      action is executed. The most tested actions are Neovim's built-in insert
      completion (see |ins-completion|).
- Automatic display in floating window of completion item info and signature 
  help (with highlighting of active parameter if LSP server provides such 
  information). After opening, window for signature help is fixed and is closed
  when there is nothing to show, text is different or when leaving Insert mode.
- Automatic actions are done after some configurable amount of delay. This 
  reduces computational load and allows fast typing (completion and signature
  help) and item selection (item info)
- Autoactions are triggered on Neovim's built-in events.
- User can force two-stage completion via |MiniCompletion.complete_twostage()|
  (by default is mapped to `<C-Space>`) or fallback completion via 
  |MiniCompletion.complete_fallback()| (maped to `<M-Space>`).

What it doesn't do:
- Snippet expansion.
- Many configurable sources.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.completion').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Delay (debounce type, in ms) between certain Neovim event and action.
  -- This can be used to (virtually) disable certain automatic actions by
  -- setting very high delay time (like 10^7).
  delay = {completion = 100, info = 100, signature = 50},

  -- Maximum dimensions of floating windows for certain actions. Action entry
  -- should be a table with 'height' and 'width' fields.
  window_dimensions = {
    info = {height = 25, width = 80},
    signature = {height = 25, width = 80}
  },

  -- Way of how module does LSP completion:
  -- - `source_func` should be one of 'completefunc' or 'omnifunc'.
  -- - `auto_setup` should be boolean indicating if LSP completion is set up on
  --   every `BufEnter` event.
  -- - `process_items` should be a function which takes LSP
  --   'textDocument/completion' response items and word to complete. Its
  --   output should be a table of the same nature as input items. The most
  --   common use-cases are custom filtering and sorting. You can use
  --   default `process_items` as `MiniCompletion.default_process_items()`.
  lsp_completion = {
    source_func = 'completefunc',
    auto_setup = true,
    process_items = --<function: filters 'not snippets' by prefix and sorts by LSP specification>,
  },

  -- Fallback action. It will always be run in Insert mode. To use Neovim's
  -- built-in completion (see `:h ins-completion`), supply its mapping as
  -- string. For example, to use 'whole lines' completion, supply '<C-x><C-l>'.
  fallback_action = --<function equivalent to '<C-n>' completion>,

  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one. Some of them
  -- might conflict with system mappings.
  mappings = {
    force_twostep  = '<C-Space>', -- Force two-step completion
    force_fallback = '<A-Space>'  -- Force fallback completion
  }

  -- Whether to set Vim's settings for better experience (modifies
  -- `shortmess` and `completeopt`)
  set_vim_settings = true
}

# Notes
- More appropriate, albeit slightly advanced, LSP completion setup is to set it
  not on every `BufEnter` event (default), but on every attach of LSP client.
  To do that:
    - Use in initial config: `lsp_completion = {source_func = 'omnifunc', 
      auto_setup = false}`.
    - In `on_attach()` of every LSP client set 'omnifunc' option to exactly 
      `v:lua.MiniCompletion.completefunc_lsp`.

# Comparisons

- 'completion-nvim':
    - Has timer activated on InsertEnter which does something every period of
      time (makes LSP request, shows floating help). MiniCompletion relies on
      Neovim's (Vim's) events.
    - Uses 'textDocument/hover' request to show completion item info.
    - Doesn't have highlighting of active parameter in signature help.
- 'nvim-cmp':
    - More elaborate design which allows multiple sources. However, it 
      currently does not have a robust 'opened buffers' source, which is very
      handy.
    - Doesn't allow fallback action.
    - Doesn't provide signature help.
- Both:
    - Can manage multiple configurable sources. MiniCompletion has only two: 
      LSP and fallback.
    - Provide advanced custom ways of filtering and sorting of completion list
      as user types. MiniCompletion in this case relies on Neovim's (which
      currently is equal to Vim's) filtering, which keeps only items which
      directly start with completed word.
    - Currently use simple text wrapping in completion item window. This module
      wraps by words (see `:h linebreak` and `:h breakat`).
    - Support snippet expansions.

Custom minimal and fast module for autohighlighting word under cursor with
customizable delay. It is triggered only if current cursor character is a
|[:keyword:]|. "Word under cursor" is meant as in Vim's |<cword>|: something
user would get as 'iw' text object. Highlighting stops in insert and terminal
modes.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.cursorword').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
 -- Delay (in ms) between when cursor moved and when highlighting appeared
 delay = 100,
}

# Highlight groups

1. `MiniCursorword` - highlight group of cursor word. Default: plain underline.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling

To disable core functionality, set `g:minicursorword_disable` (globally) or

                                                        *MiniFuzzy* *mini.fuzzy*

Lua module which implements minimal and fast fuzzy matching.

# Setup

This module doesn't need setup, but it can be done to improve usability. Setup
with `require('mini.fuzzy').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Maximum allowed value of match features (width and first match). All
  -- feature values greater than cutoff can be considered "equally bad".
  cutoff = 100,
}

# Notes
1. Currently there is no explicit design to work with multibyte symbols, but
   simple examples should work.
2. Smart case is used: case insensitive if input word (which is usually a user
   input) is all lower ase. Case sensitive otherwise.

# Algorithm design

General design uses only width of found match and index of first letter match.
No special characters or positions (like in fzy and fzf) are used.

Given input `word` and target `candidate`:
- The goal is to find matching between `word`'s letters and letters in 
  `candidate`, which minimizes certain score. It is assumed that order of 
  letters in `word` and those matched in `candidate` should be the same.
- Matching is represented by matched positions: a list `positions` of integers
  with length equal to number of letter in `word`. The following should be
  always true in case of a match: `candidate`'s letter at index `positions[i]`
  is letters[i]` for all valid `i`.
- Matched positions are evaluated based only on two features: their width 
  (number of indexes between first and last positions) and first match (index
  of first letter match). There is a global setting `cutoff` for which all
  feature values greater than it can be considered "equally bad".
- Score of matched positions is computed with following explicit formula: 
  `cutoff * min(width, cutoff) + min(first, cutoff)`. It is designed to be 
  equivalent to first comparing widths (lower is better) and then comparing 
  first match (lower is better). For example, if `word = 'time'`:
    - '_time' (width 4) will have a better match than 't_ime' (width 5).
    - 'time_a' (width 4, first 1) will have a better match than 'a_time' (width
      4, first 3).
- Final matched positions are those which minimize score among all possible 
  matched positions of `word` and `candidate`.

        {text_width} (number)  Number of editable columns resized window will
                               display. Default: first element of
                               'colorcolumn' or otherwise 'textwidth' (using
                               screen width as its default but not more than
                               79).


MiniMisc.stat_summary({t})                           *MiniMisc.stat_summary()*
    Compute summary statistics of numerical list

    This might be useful to compute summary of time benchmarking with
    |MiniMisc.bench_time|.



    Parameters: ~
        {t} (table)  List (table suitable for `ipairs`) of numbers.

    Return: ~
        table: Table with summary values under following keys (may be extended
        in the future): `maximum`, `mean`, `median`, `minimum`, `n` (number of
        elements), `sd` (sample standard deviation).


MiniMisc.tbl_head({t}, {n})                              *MiniMisc.tbl_head()*
    Return "first" elements of table as decided by `pairs`

    Note: order of elements might vary.



    Parameters: ~
        {t} (table)
        {n} (number)  Maximum number of first elements. Default: 5.

    Return: ~
        table: Table with at most `n` first elements of `t` (with same keys).


MiniMisc.tbl_tail({t}, {n})                              *MiniMisc.tbl_tail()*
    Return "last" elements of table as decided by `pairs`

    This function makes two passes through elements of `t`:
    - First to count number of elements.
    - Second to construct result.

    Note: order of elements might vary.



    Parameters: ~
        {t} (table)
        {n} (number)  Maximum number of last elements. Default: 5.

    Return: ~
        table: Table with at most `n` last elements of `t` (with same keys).


MiniMisc.use_nested_comments({buf_id})        *MiniMisc.use_nested_comments()*
    Add possibility of nested comment leader.

    This works by parsing 'commentstring' buffer option, extracting
    non-whitespace comment leader (symbols on the left of commented line), and
    locally modifying 'comments' option (by prepending `n:<leader>`). Does
    nothing if 'commentstring' is empty or has comment symbols both in front
    and back (like "/*%s*/").

    Nested comment leader added with this function is useful for formatting
    nested comments. For example, have in Lua "first-level" comments with '--'
    and "second-level" comments with '----'. With nested comment leader second
    type can be formatted with `gq` in the same way as first one.

    Recommended usage is with |autocmd|:
    `autocmd BufEnter * lua pcall(require('mini.misc').use_nested_comments)`

    Note: for most filetypes 'commentstring' option is added only when buffer
    with this filetype is entered, so using non-current `buf_id` can not lead
    to desired effect.



    Parameters: ~
        {buf_id} (number)  Buffer identifier (see |bufnr()|) in which function
                           will operate. Default: 0 for current.


MiniMisc.zoom({buf_id}, {config})                            *MiniMisc.zoom()*
    Zoom in and out of a buffer, making it full screen in a floating window

    This function is useful when working with multiple windows but temporarily
    needing to zoom into one to see more of the code from that buffer. Call it
    again (without arguments) to zoom out.



    Parameters: ~
        {buf_id} (number)  Buffer identifier (see |bufnr()|) to be zoomed.
                           Default: 0 for current.
        {config} (table)   Optional config for window (as for
                           |nvim_open_win()|).



================================================================================
                                                        *MiniPairs* *mini.pairs*

Custom minimal and fast autopairs Lua module. It provides functionality to work
with 'paired' characters conditional on cursor's neighborhood (two characters
to its left and right). Its usage should be through making appropriate `<expr>`
mappings.

What it doesn't do:
- It doesn't support multiple characters as "open" and "close" symbols. Use 
  snippets for that.
- It doesn't support dependency on filetype. Use |i_CTRL-V| to insert single
  symbol or `autocmd` command or 'after/ftplugin' approach to:
    - Disable module for buffer (see 'Disabling' section).
    - `inoremap <buffer> <*> <*>` : return mapping of '<*>' to its original 
      action, virtually unmapping.
    - `inoremap <buffer> <expr> <*> v:lua.MiniPairs.?` : make new buffer
      mapping for '<*>'.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.pairs').setup({})` (replace `{}`
with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- In which modes mappings should be created
  modes = {insert = true, command = false, terminal = false}
}

By default in `MiniPairs.setup()`:
- The following pairs are respected: `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `\`\``. 
  Single opening symbol is inserted after `\`. Single `'` is inserted after a
  letter (to be used in English comments).
- `<BS>` respects same pairs.
- `<CR>` is mapped only in insert mode and respects `()`, `[]`, `{}`.

# Example mappings

- Insert `<>` pair if `<` is typed as first character in line:
    Vimscript:
    `inoremap <expr> < v:lua.MiniPairs.open('<>', "\r.")`
    `inoremap <expr> > v:lua.MiniPairs.close('<>', "..")`
    Lua:
    `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.open('<>', "\r.")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`
    `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '>', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.close('<>', "..")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`
- Create symmerical `$$` pair only in Tex files:
    Vimscript:
    `au FileType tex inoremap <buffer> <expr> $ v:lua.MiniPairs.closeopen('$$', "[^\\].")`
    Lua:
    `au FileType tex lua vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(0, 'i', '$', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.closeopen('$$', "[^\\].")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`

# Notes
- Make sure to make proper mapping of `<CR>` in order to support completion 
  plugin of your choice.
- Having mapping in terminal mode can conflict with:
    - Autopairing capabilities of interpretators (`ipython`, `radian`).
    - Vim mode of terminal itself.

# Disabling

To disable, set `g:minipairs_disable` (globally) or `b:minipairs_disable` (for
a buffer) to `v:true`.

MiniPairs.setup({config})                                  *MiniPairs.setup()*
    Module setup



    Parameters: ~
        {config} (table)  Module config table.

    Usage: ~
        `require('mini.completion').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your
        `config` table)


MiniPairs.open({pair}, {twochars_pattern})                  *MiniPairs.open()*
    Process 'open' symbols

    Use this for mapping 'open' symbols in asymmetric pair ('(', '[', etc.). If
    neighborhood doesn't match supplied pattern, function results into 'open'
    symbol. Otherwise, it pastes whole pair and moves inside pair with
    |<Left>|.

    Example:
    - Vimscript: `inoremap <expr> ( v:lua.MiniPairs.open('()', "[^\\].")`
    - Lua: `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '(', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.open('()', "[^\\].")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`



    Parameters: ~
        {pair}             (string)  String with two characters representing
                                     pair.
        {twochars_pattern} (string)  Pattern for two neighborhood characters
                                     ("\r" line start, "\n" - line end).


MiniPairs.close({pair}, {twochars_pattern})                *MiniPairs.close()*
    Process 'close' symbols

    Use this for mapping 'close' symbols in asymmetric pair (')', ']', etc.).
    If neighborhood doesn't match supplied pattern, function results into
    'close' symbol. Otherwise it jumps over symbol to the right of cursor (with
    |<Right>|) if it is equal to 'close' one and inserts it otherwise.

    Example:
    - Vimscript: `inoremap <expr> ) v:lua.MiniPairs.close('()', "[^\\].")`
    - Lua: `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', ')', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.close('()', "[^\\].")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`



    Parameters: ~
        {pair}             (string)  String with two characters representing
                                     pair.
        {twochars_pattern} (string)  Pattern for two neighborhood characters
                                     ("\r" line start, "\n" - line end).


MiniPairs.closeopen({pair}, {twochars_pattern})        *MiniPairs.closeopen()*
    Process 'closeopen' symbols

    Use this for mapping 'symmetrical' symbols (from pairs '""', '\'\'', '``').
    It tries to perform 'closeopen action': move over right character (with
    |<Right>|) if it is equal to second character from pair or conditionally
    paste pair otherwise (with |MiniPairs.open()|).

    Example:
    - Vimscript: `inoremap <expr> " v:lua.MiniPairs.closeopen('""', "[^\\].")`
    - Lua: `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '"', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.closeopen('""', "[^\\].")]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`



    Parameters: ~
        {pair}             (string)  String with two characters representing
                                     pair.
        {twochars_pattern} (string)  Pattern for two neighborhood characters
                                     ("\r" line start, "\n" - line end).


MiniPairs.bs({pair_set})                                      *MiniPairs.bs()*
    Process |<BS>|

    Use this to map `<BS>`. It removes whole pair (via `<BS><Del>`) if
    neighborhood is equal to whole pair.

    Example:
    - Vimscript: `inoremap <expr> <BS> v:lua.MiniPairs.bs(['()', '[]', '{}', '""', "''", '``'])`
    - Lua: `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<BS>', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.bs(['()', '[]', '{}', '""', "''", '``'])]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`



    Parameters: ~
        {pair_set} (table)  List with pairs which trigger extra action.


MiniPairs.cr({pair_set})                                      *MiniPairs.cr()*
    Process |i_<CR>|

    Use this to map `<CR>` in insert mode. It puts "close" symbol on next line
    (via `<CR><C-o>O`) if neighborhood is equal to whole pair. Should be used
    only in insert mode.

    Example:
    - Vimscript: `inoremap <expr> <CR> v:lua.MiniPairs.cr(['()', '[]', '{}'])`
    - Lua: `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('i', '<CR>', [[v:lua.MiniPairs.cr(['()', '[]', '{}'])]], { expr = true, noremap = true })`



    Parameters: ~
        {pair_set} (table)  List with pairs which trigger extra action.

                                              *MiniStatusline* *mini.statusline*

Custom minimal and fast statusline module with opinionated default look.
Special features: change color depending on current mode and compact version of
sections activated when window width is small enough.

Features:
- Built-in active mode indicator with colors.
- Sections can hide information when window is too narrow (specific window 
  width is configurable per section).
- Define own custom statusline structure for active and inactive windows. This
  is done with a function which should return string appropriate for 
  |statusline|. Its code should be similar to default one with structure:
    - Compute string data for every section you want to be displayed.
    - Combine them in groups with |MiniStatusline.combine_groups()|.

# Dependencies

Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality, statusline will work
without them):
- Nerd font (to support extra icons).
- Plugin 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim' for Git information in 
  |MiniStatusline.section_git|. If missing, no section will be shown.
- Plugin 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons' for filetype icons in 
  `MiniStatusline.section_fileinfo`. If missing, no icons will be shown.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.statusline').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Content of statusline as functions which return statusline string. See `:h
  -- statusline` and code of default contents (used when `nil` is supplied).
  content = {
    -- Content for active window
    active = nil,

    -- Content for inactive window(s)
    inactive = nil,
  },

  -- Whether to set Vim's settings for statusline (make it always shown)
  set_vim_settings = true,
}

# Example content

## Default content

This function is used as default value for active content:
`function()`
  `local mode, mode_hl = MiniStatusline.section_mode({ trunc_width = 120 })`
  `local git           = MiniStatusline.section_git({ trunc_width = 75 })`
  `local diagnostics   = MiniStatusline.section_diagnostics({ trunc_width = 75 })`
  `local filename      = MiniStatusline.section_filename({ trunc_width = 140 })`
  `local fileinfo      = MiniStatusline.section_fileinfo({ trunc_width = 120 })`
  `local location      = MiniStatusline.section_location({ trunc_width = 75 })`

  `return MiniStatusline.combine_groups({`
    `{ hl = mode_hl,                  strings = { mode } },`
    `{ hl = 'MiniStatuslineDevinfo',  strings = { git, diagnostics } },`
    `'%<', -- Mark general truncate point`
    `{ hl = 'MiniStatuslineFilename', strings = { filename } },`
    `'%=', -- End left alignment`
    `{ hl = 'MiniStatuslineFileinfo', strings = { fileinfo } },`
    `{ hl = mode_hl,                  strings = { location } },`
  `})`
`end`

## Show boolean options

To compute section string for boolean option use variation of this code snippet
inside content function (you can modify option itself, truncation width, short
and long displayed names):

`local spell = vim.wo.spell and (MiniStatusline.is_truncated(120) and 'S' or 'SPELL') or ''`

Here `x and y or z` is a common Lua way of doing ternary operator: if `x` is
`true`-ish then return `y`, if not - return `z`.

# Highlight groups

1. Highlighting depending on mode (returned as second value from 
   |MiniStatusline.section_mode|):
    - `MiniStatuslineModeNormal` - normal mode.
    - `MiniStatuslineModeInsert` - insert mode.
    - `MiniStatuslineModeVisual` - visual mode.
    - `MiniStatuslineModeReplace` - replace mode.
    - `MiniStatuslineModeCommand` - command mode.
    - `MiniStatuslineModeOther` - other mode (like terminal, etc.).
2. Highlight groups used in default statusline:
    - `MiniStatuslineDevinfo` - highlighting of "dev info" group 
      (|MiniStatusline.section_git| and |MiniStatusline.section_diagnostics|).
    - `MiniStatuslineFilename` - highliting of 
      |MiniStatusline.section_filename| section.
    - `MiniStatuslineFileinfo` - highliting of 
      |MiniStatusline.section_fileinfo| section.
3. `MiniStatuslineInactive` - highliting in not focused window.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling

To disable (show empty statusline), set `g:ministatusline_disable` (globally)
or `b:ministatusline_disable` (for a buffer) to `v:true`.

MiniStatusline.setup({config})                        *MiniStatusline.setup()*
    Module setup



    Parameters: ~
        {config} (table)  Module config table.

    Usage: ~
        `require('mini.statusline').setup({})` (replace `{}` with your
        `config` table)


MiniStatusline.active()                              *MiniStatusline.active()*
    Compute content for active window



MiniStatusline.inactive()                          *MiniStatusline.inactive()*
    Compute content for inactive window



MiniStatusline.combine_groups({groups})      *MiniStatusline.combine_groups()*
    Combine groups of sections

    Each group can be either a string or a table with fields `hl` (group's
    highlight group) and `strings` (strings representing sections).

    General idea of this function is as follows. String group is used as is
    (useful for special strings like `%<` or `%=`). Each group defined by table
    has own highlighting (if not supplied explicitly, the previous one is
    used). Non-empty strings inside group are separated by one space. Non-empty
    groups are separated by two spaces (one for each highlighting).



    Parameters: ~
        {groups} (table)  List of groups

    Return: ~
        string: String suitable for 'statusline'.


MiniStatusline.is_truncated({trunc_width})     *MiniStatusline.is_truncated()*
    Decide whether to truncate

    This basically computes window width and compares it to `trunc_width`: if
    window is smaller then truncate; otherwise don't. Don't truncate by
    default.

    Use this to manually decide if section needs truncation or not.



    Parameters: ~
        {trunc_width} (number)  Truncation width. If `nil`, output is `false`.

    Return: ~
        boolean: Whether to truncate.


MiniStatusline.section_mode({args})            *MiniStatusline.section_mode()*
    Section for Vim |mode()|

    Short output is returned if window width is lower than `args.trunc_width`.



    Parameters: ~
        {args} (table)  Section arguments.

    Return: ~
        section_string, mode_hl tuple: Section string and mode's highlight
        group.


MiniStatusline.section_git({args})              *MiniStatusline.section_git()*
    Section for Git information

    Normal output contains name of `HEAD` (via |b:gitsigns_head|) and chunk
    information (via |b:gitsigns_status|). Short output - only name of `HEAD`.
    Note: requires 'lewis6991/gitsigns' plugin.

    Short output is returned if window width is lower than `args.trunc_width`.



    Parameters: ~
        {args} (table)  Section arguments.

    Return: ~
        string: Section string.


MiniStatusline.section_diagnostics({args}) *MiniStatusline.section_diagnostics()*
    Section for Neovim's builtin diagnostics

    Shows nothing if there is no attached LSP clients or for short output.
    Otherwise uses |vim.lsp.diagnostic.get_count()| to show number of errors
    ('E'), warnings ('W'), information ('I'), and hints ('H').

    Short output is returned if window width is lower than `args.trunc_width`.



    Parameters: ~
        {args} (table)  Section arguments.

    Return: ~
        string: Section string.


MiniStatusline.section_filename({args})    *MiniStatusline.section_filename()*

    Section for file information

    Short output contains only extension and is returned if window width is
    lower than `args.trunc_width`.



    Parameters: ~
        {args} (table)  Section arguments.

    Return: ~
        string: Section string.


MiniStatusline.section_location({args})    *MiniStatusline.section_location()*
    Section for location inside buffer

    Show location inside buffer in the form:
    - Normal: '<cursor line>|<total lines>│<cursor column>|<total columns>'.
    - Short: '<cursor line>│<cursor column>'.

    Short output is returned if window width is lower than `args.trunc_width`.



    Parameters: ~
        {args} (table)  Section arguments.

    Return: ~

================================================================================
                                                  *MiniSurround* *mini.surround*

Custom somewhat minimal and fast surrounding Lua plugin. This is mostly a
reimplementation of the core features of 'machakann/vim-sandwich' with a couple
more on top (find surrounding, highlight surrounding).

Features:
- Actions (all of them are dot-repeatable out of the box):
    - Add surrounding with `sa` (in visual mode or on motion).
    - Delete surrounding with `sd`.
    - Replace surrounding with `sr`.
    - Find surrounding with `sf` or `sF` (move cursor right or left).
    - Highlight surrounding with `sh`.
    - Change number of neighbor lines with `sn` (see algorithm details).
- Surrounding is identified by a single character as both 'input' (in `delete`
  and `replace` start) and 'output' (in `add` and `replace` end):
    - 'f' - function call (string of letters or '_' or '.' followed by balanced
      '()'). In 'input' finds function call, in 'output' prompts user to enter
      function name.
    - 'i' - interactive. Prompts user to enter left and right parts.
    - 't' - tag. In 'input' finds tab with same identifier, in 'output' prompts
      user to enter tag name.
    - All symbols in brackets '()', '[]', '{}', '<>'. In 'input' represents 
      balanced brackets, in 'output' - left and right parts of brackets.
    - All other alphanumeric, punctuation, or space characters represent 
      surrounding with identical left and right parts.

Known issues which won't be resolved:
- Search for surrounding is done using Lua patterns (regex-like approach). So
  certain amount of false positives should be expected.
- When searching for 'input' surrounding, there is no distinction if it is 
  inside string or comment. So in this case there will be not proper match for
  a function call: 'f(a = ")", b = 1)'.
- Tags are searched using regex-like methods, so issues are inevitable. Overall
  it is pretty good, but certain cases won't work. Like self-nested tags won't
  match correctly on both ends: '<a><a></a></a>'.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.surround').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Number of lines within which surrounding is searched
  n_lines = 20,

  -- Duration (in ms) of highlight when calling `MiniSurround.highlight()`
  highlight_duration = 500,

  -- Pattern to match function name in 'function call' surrounding
  -- By default it is a string of letters, '_' or '.'
  funname_pattern = '[%w_%.]+',

  -- Mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one.
  mappings = {
    add = 'sa',           -- Add surrounding
    delete = 'sd',        -- Delete surrounding
    find = 'sf',          -- Find surrounding (to the right)
    find_left = 'sF',     -- Find surrounding (to the left)
    highlight = 'sh',     -- Highlight surrounding
    replace = 'sr',       -- Replace surrounding
    update_n_lines = 'sn' -- Update `n_lines`
  }
}

# Example usage

- `saiw)` - add (`sa`) for inner word (`iw`) parenthesis (`)`).
- `saiwi[[<CR>]]<CR>` - add (`sa`) for inner word (`iw`) interactive 
  surrounding (`i`): `[[` for left and `]]` for right.
- `sdf` - delete (`sd`) surrounding function call (`f`).
- `sr)tdiv<CR>` - replace (`sr`) surrounding parenthesis (`)`) with tag (`t`)
  with identifier 'div' (`div<CR>` in command line prompt).
- `sff` - find right (`sf`) part of surrounding function call (`f`).
- `sh}` - highlight (`sh`) for a brief period of time surrounding curly 
  brackets (`}`)

# Algorithm design

- Adding 'output' surrounding has a fairly straightforward algorithm:
    - Determine places for left and right parts (via `<>` or `[]` marks).
    - Determine left and right parts of surrounding.
    - Properly add.
- Finding 'input' surrounding is a lot more complicated and is a reason why 
  this implementation is only somewhat minimal. In a nutshell, current 
  algorithm `searches in the neighborhood lines based on a certain pattern a
  _smallest_ match that covers cursor`. More detailed:
    - Extract neighborhood of cursor line: no more than 
      `MiniSurround.config.n_lines` before, cursor line itself, no more than 
      `MiniSurround.config.n_lines` after.
    - Convert it to '1d neighborhood' by concatenating with '\n' delimiter. 
      Compute location of current cursor position in this line.
    - Given Lua pattern for a 'input' surrounding, search for a smallest (with
      minimal width) match that covers cursor position. This is an iterative
      procedure, duration of which heavily depends on the length of '1d
      neighborhood' and frequency of pattern matching. If no match is found,
      there is no surrounding.
    - Compute parts of '1d neighborhood' that represent left and right part of
      found surrounding. This is done by using 'extract' pattern computed for
      every type of surrounding.
    - Convert '1d offsets' of found parts to their positions in buffer. Actual
      search is done firstly on cursor line (as it is the most frequent usage)
      and only then searches in neighborhood.

                                                    *MiniTabline* *mini.tabline*

Custom minimal and fast tabline module. General idea: show all listed buffers
in readable way with minimal total width in case of one vim tab, fall back for
deafult otherwise. Inspired by
[ap/vim-buftabline](https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline).

Features:
- Buffers are listed by their identifier (see |bufnr()|).
- Different highlight groups for "states" of buffer affecting 'buffer tabs':
- Buffer names are made unique by extending paths to files or appending unique
  identifier to buffers without name.
- Current buffer is displayed "optimally centered" (in center of screen while
  maximizing the total number of buffers shown) when there are many buffers
  open.
- 'Buffer tabs' are clickable if Neovim allows it.

What it doesn't do:
- Custom buffer order is not supported.

# Dependencies

Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality, tabline will work without
them):
- Plugin 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons' for filetype icons near the buffer 
  name. If missing, no icons will be shown.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.tabline').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Whether to show file icons (requires 'kyazdani42/nvim-web-devicons')
  show_icons = true,

  -- Whether to set Vim's settings for tabline (make it always shown and
  -- allow hidden buffers)
  set_vim_settings = true
}

# Highlight groups

1. `MiniTablineCurrent` - buffer is current (has cursor in it).
2. `MiniTablineVisible` - buffer is visible (displayed in some window).
3. `MiniTablineHidden` - buffer is hidden (not displayed).
4. `MiniTablineModifiedCurrent` - buffer is modified and current.
5. `MiniTablineModifiedVisible` - buffer is modified and visible.
6. `MiniTablineModifiedHidden` - buffer is modified and hidden.
7. `MiniTablineFill` - unused right space of tabline.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling

To disable (show empty tabline), set `g:minitabline_disable` (globally) or
`b:minitabline_disable` (for a buffer) to `v:true`. Note: after disabling
tabline is not updated right away, but rather after dedicated event (see

Custom minimal and fast module for working with trailing whitespace.

Features:
- Highlighting is done only in modifiable buffer by default; only in Normal 
  mode; stops in Insert mode and when leaving window.
- Trim all trailing whitespace with |MiniTrailspace.trim()| function.

# Setup

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.trailspace').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table).

Default `config`:
{
  -- Highlight only in normal buffers (ones with empty 'buftype'). This is
  -- useful to not show trailing whitespace where it usually doesn't matter.
