*mini.ai* Extend and create a/i textobjects
*MiniAi*

==============================================================================

Enhance some builtin |text-objects| (like |a(|, |a)|, |a'|, and more),
create new ones (like `a*`, `a<Space>`, `af`, `a?`, and more), and allow
user to create their own.

Features:
- Customizable creation of `a`/`i` textobjects using Lua patterns and functions.
  Supports:
    - Dot-repeat.
    - |v:count|.
    - Different search methods (see |MiniAi.config|).
    - Consecutive application (update selection without leaving Visual mode).
    - Aliases for multiple textobjects.

- Comprehensive builtin textobjects (see more in |MiniAi-textobject-builtin|):
    - Balanced brackets (with and without whitespace) plus alias.
    - Balanced quotes plus alias.
    - Function call.
    - Argument.
    - Tag.
    - Derived from user prompt.
    - Default for punctuation, digit, or whitespace single character.

- Motions for jumping to left/right edge of textobject.

- Set of specification generators to tweak some builtin textobjects (see
  |MiniAi.gen_spec|).

- Treesitter textobjects (through |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()| helper).

This module works by defining mappings for both `a` and `i` in Visual and
Operator-pending mode. After typing, they wait for single character user input
treated as textobject identifier and apply resolved textobject specification
(fall back to other mappings if can't find proper textobject id). For more
information see |MiniAi-textobject-specification| and |MiniAi-algorithm|.

Known issues which won't be resolved:
- Search for builtin textobjects is done mostly using Lua patterns
  (regex-like approach). Certain amount of false positives is to be expected.

- During search for builtin textobjects there is no distinction if it is
  inside string or comment. For example, in the following case there will
  be wrong match for a function call: `f(a = ")", b = 1)`.

General rule of thumb: any instrument using available parser for document
structure (like treesitter) will usually provide more precise results. This
module has builtins mostly for plain text textobjects which are useful
most of the times (like "inside brackets", "around quotes/underscore", etc.).
For advanced use cases define function specification for custom textobjects.

What it doesn't (and probably won't) do:
- Have special operators to specially handle whitespace (like `I` and `A`
  in 'targets.vim'). Whitespace handling is assumed to be done inside
  textobject specification (like `i(` and `i)` handle whitespace differently).

# Setup~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.ai').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniAi`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniAi.*`).

See |MiniAi.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings (like `config.custom_textobjects`)
locally to buffer inside `vim.b.miniai_config` which should have same structure
as `MiniAi.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.

# Comparisons~

- 'wellle/targets.vim':
    - Has limited support for creating own textobjects: it is constrained
      to pre-defined detection rules. 'mini.ai' allows creating own rules
      via Lua patterns and functions (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).
    - Doesn't provide any programmatical API for getting information about
      textobjects. 'mini.ai' does it via |MiniAi.find_textobject()|.
    - Has no implementation of "moving to edge of textobject". 'mini.ai'
      does it via |MiniAi.move_cursor()| and `g[` and `g]` default mappings.
    - Has elaborate ways to control searching of the next textobject.
      'mini.ai' relies on handful of 'config.search_method'.
    - Implements `A`, `I` operators. 'mini.ai' does not by design: it is
      assumed to be a property of textobject, not operator.
    - Doesn't implement "function call" and "user prompt" textobjects.
      'mini.ai' does (with `f` and `?` identifiers).
    - Has limited support for "argument" textobject. Although it works in
      most situations, it often misdetects commas as argument separator
      (like if it is inside quotes or `{}`). 'mini.ai' deals with these cases.
- 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects':
    - Along with textobject functionality provides a curated and maintained
      set of popular textobject queries for many languages (which can power
      |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()| functionality).
    - Operates with custome treesitter directives (see
      |lua-treesitter-directives|) allowing more fine-tuned textobjects.
    - Implements only textobjects based on treesitter.
    - Doesn't support |v:count|.
    - Doesn't support multiple search method (basically, only 'cover').
    - Doesn't support consecutive application of target textobject.

# Disabling~

To disable, set `vim.g.miniai_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.miniai_disable`
(for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
recipes.

Builtin textobjects~

This table describes all builtin textobjects along with what they
represent. Explanation:
- `Key` represents the textobject identifier: single character which should
  be typed after `a`/`i`.
- `Name` is a description of textobject.
- `Example line` contains a string for which examples are constructed. The
  `*` denotes the cursor position.
- `a`/`i` describe inclusive region representing `a` and `i` textobjects.
  Use numbers in separators for easier navigation.
- `2a`/`2i` describe either `2a`/`2i` (support for |v:count|) textobjects
  or `a`/`i` textobject followed by another `a`/`i` textobject (consecutive
  application leads to incremental selection).

Example: typing `va)` with cursor on `*` leads to selection from column 2
to column 12. Another typing `a)` changes selection to [1; 13]. Also, besides
visual selection, any |operator| can be used or `g[`/`g]` motions to move
to left/right edge of `a` textobject.

Notes:
- All examples assume default `config.search_method`.
- Open brackets differ from close brackets by how they treat inner edge
  whitespace for `i` textobject: open ignores it, close - includes.
- Default textobject is activated for identifiers from digits (0, ..., 9),
  punctuation (like `_`, `*`, `,`, etc.), whitespace (space, tab, etc.).
  They are designed to be treated as separators, so include only right edge
  in `a` textobject. To include both edges, use custom textobjects
  (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification| and |MiniAi.config|).

                                                               *MiniAi-glossary*
- REGION - table representing region in a buffer. Fields:
    - <from> and <to> for inclusive start and end positions (<to> might be
      `nil` to describe empty region). Each position is also a table with
      line <line> and column <col> (both start at 1).
    - <vis_mode> for which Visual mode will be used to select textobject.
      See `opts` argument of |MiniAi.select_textobject()|.
      One of `'v'`, `'V'`, `'\22'` (escaped `'<C-v>'`).
  Examples:
  - `{ from = { line = 1, col = 1 }, to = { line = 2, col = 1 } }`
  - Force linewise mode: >
    {
      from = { line = 1, col = 1 }, to = { line = 2, col = 1 },
      vis_mode = 'V',
    }
<  - Empty region: `{ from = { line = 10, col = 10 } }`
- PATTERN - string describing Lua pattern.
- SPAN - interval inside a string (end-exclusive). Like [1, 5). Equal
  `from` and `to` edges describe empty span at that point.
- SPAN `A = [a1, a2)` COVERS `B = [b1, b2)` if every element of
  `B` is within `A` (`a1 <= b < a2`).
  It also is described as B IS NESTED INSIDE A.
- NESTED PATTERN - array of patterns aimed to describe nested spans.
- SPAN MATCHES NESTED PATTERN if there is a sequence of consecutively
  nested spans each matching corresponding pattern within substring of
  previous span (or input string for first span). Example:
    Nested patterns: `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$' }` (balanced `()` with inner space)
    Input string: `( ( () ( ) ) )`
                  `123456789012345`
  Here are all matching spans [1, 15) and [3, 13). Both [5, 7) and [8, 10)
  match first pattern but not second. All other combinations of `(` and `)`
  don't match first pattern (not balanced).
- COMPOSED PATTERN: array with each element describing possible pattern
  (or array of them) at that place. Composed pattern basically defines all
  possible combinations of nested pattern (their cartesian product).
  Examples:
    1. Composed pattern: `{ { '%b()', '%b[]' }, '^. .* .$' }`
       Composed pattern expanded into equivalent array of nested patterns:
        `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$' }` and `{ '%b[]', '^. .* .$' }`
       Description: either balanced `()` or balanced `[]` but both with
       inner edge space.
    2. Composed pattern:
       `{ { { '%b()', '^. .* .$' }, { '%b[]', '^.[^ ].*[^ ].$' } }, '.....' }`
       Composed pattern expanded into equivalent array of nested patterns:
       `{ '%b()', '^. .* .$', '.....' }` and
       `{ '%b[]', '^.[^ ].*[^ ].$', '.....' }`
       Description: either "balanced `()` with inner edge space" or
       "balanced `[]` with no inner edge space", both with 5 or more characters.
- SPAN MATCHES COMPOSED PATTERN if it matches at least one nested pattern
  from expanded composed pattern.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *MiniAi-textobject-specification*
Textobject specification has a structure of composed pattern (see
|MiniAi-glossary|) with two differences:
- Last pattern(s) should have even number of empty capture groups denoting
  how the last string should be processed to extract `a` or `i` textobject:
    - Zero captures mean that whole string represents both `a` and `i`.
      Example: `xxx` will define textobject matching string `xxx` literally.
    - Two captures represent `i` textobject inside of them. `a` - whole string.
      Example: `x()x()x` defines `a` textobject to be `xxx`, `i` - middle `x`.
    - Four captures define `a` textobject inside captures 1 and 4, `i` -
      inside captures 2 and 3. Example: `x()()x()x()` defines `a`
      textobject to be last `xx`, `i` - middle `x`.
- Allows callable objects (see |vim.is_callable()|) in certain places
  (enables more complex textobjects in exchange of increase in configuration
  complexity and computations):
    - If specification itself is a callable, it will be called with the same
      arguments as |MiniAi.find_textobject()| and should return one of:
        - Composed pattern. Useful for implementing user input. Example of
          simplified variant of textobject for function call with name taken
          from user prompt:
>
          function()
            local left_edge = vim.pesc(vim.fn.input('Function name: '))
            return { string.format('%s+%%b()', left_edge), '^.-%(().*()%)$' }
          end
<
        - Single output region. Useful to allow full control over
          textobject. Will be taken as is. Example of returning whole buffer:
>
          function()
            local from = { line = 1, col = 1 }
            local to = {
              line = vim.fn.line('$'),
              col = math.max(vim.fn.getline('$'):len(), 1)
            }
            return { from = from, to = to, vis_mode = 'V' }
          end
<
        - Array of output region(s). Useful for incorporating other
          instruments, like treesitter (see |MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()|).
          The best region will be picked in the same manner as with composed
          pattern (respecting options `n_lines`, `search_method`, etc.).
          Example of selecting "best" line with display width more than 80:
>
          function(_, _, _)
            local res = {}
            for i = 1, vim.api.nvim_buf_line_count(0) do
              local cur_line = vim.fn.getline(i)
              if vim.fn.strdisplaywidth(cur_line) > 80 then
                local region = {
                  from = { line = i, col = 1 },
                  to = { line = i, col = cur_line:len() },
                }
                table.insert(res, region)
              end
            end
            return res
          end
<
    - If there is a callable instead of assumed string pattern, it is expected
      to have signature `(line, init)` and behave like `pattern:find()`.
      It should return two numbers representing span in `line` next after
      or at `init` (`nil` if there is no such span).
      !IMPORTANT NOTE!: it means that output's `from` shouldn't be strictly
      to the left of `init` (it will lead to infinite loop). Not allowed as
      last item (as it should be pattern with captures).
      Example of matching only balanced parenthesis with big enough width:
>
        {
          '%b()',
          function(s, init)
            if init > 1 or s:len() < 5 then return end
            return 1, s:len()
          end,
          '^.().*().$'
        }
>
More examples:
- See |MiniAi.gen_spec| for function wrappers to create commonly used
  textobject specifications.

- Pair of balanced brackets from set (used for builtin `b` identifier):
  `{ { '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }, '^.().*().$' }`

- Imitate word ignoring digits and punctuation (supports only Latin alphabet):
  `{ '()()%f[%w]%w+()[ \t]*()' }`

- Word with camel case support (also supports only Latin alphabet):
  `{`
    `{`
      `'%u[%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
      `'%f[%S][%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
      `'%f[%P][%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
      `'^[%l%d]+%f[^%l%d]',`
    `},`
    `'^().*()$'`
  `}`

- Number: `{ '%f[%d]%d+' }`

- Date in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format: `{ '()%d%d%d%d%-%d%d%-%d%d()' }`

- Lua block string: `{ '%[%[().-()%]%]' }`

                                                              *MiniAi-algorithm*
Algorithm design

Search for the textobjects relies on these principles:
- It uses same input data as described in |MiniAi.find_textobject()|,
  i.e. whether it is `a` or `i` textobject, its identifier, reference region, etc.
- Textobject specification is constructed based on textobject identifier
  (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).
- General search is done by converting some 2d buffer region (neighborhood
  of reference region) into 1d string (each line is appended with `\n`).
  Then search for a best span matching textobject specification is done
  inside string (see |MiniAi-glossary|). After that, span is converted back
  into 2d region. Note: first search is done inside reference region lines,
  and only after that - inside its neighborhood within `config.n_lines`
  (see |MiniAi.config|).
- The best matching span is chosen by iterating over all spans matching
  textobject specification and comparing them with "current best".
  Comparison also depends on reference region (tighter covering is better,
  otherwise closer is better) and search method (if span is even considered).
- Extract span based on extraction pattern (last item in nested pattern).
- If task is to perform a consecutive search (`opts.n_times` is greater than 1),
  steps are repeated with current best match becoming reference region.
  One such additional step is also done if final region is equal to
  reference region (this enables consecutive application).

Notes:
- Iteration over all matched spans is done in depth-first fashion with
  respect to nested pattern.
- It is guaranteed that span is compared only once.
- For the sake of increasing functionality, during iteration over all
  matching spans, some Lua patterns in composed pattern are handled
  specially.
    - `%bxx` (`xx` is two identical characters). It denotes balanced pair
      of identical characters and results into "paired" matches. For
      example, `%b""` for `"aa" "bb"` would match `"aa"` and `"bb"`, but
      not middle `" "`.
    - `x.-y` (`x` and `y` are different strings). It results only in matches with
      smallest width. For example, `e.-o` for `e e o o` will result only in
      middle `e o`. Note: it has some implications for when parts have
      quantifiers (like `+`, etc.), which usually can be resolved with
      frontier pattern `%f[]` (see examples in |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).

## Custom textobjects ~

Each named entry of `config.custom_textobjects` is a textobject with
that identifier and specification (see |MiniAi-textobject-specification|).
They are also used to override builtin ones (|MiniAi-textobject-builtin|).
Supply non-valid input (not in specification format) to disable module's
builtin textobject in favor of external or Neovim's builtin mapping.

Examples:
>
  require('mini.ai').setup({
    custom_textobjects = {
      -- Tweak argument textobject
      a = require('mini.ai').gen_spec.argument({ brackets = { '%b()' } }),

      -- Disable brackets alias in favor of builtin block textobject
      b = false,

      -- Now `vax` should select `xxx` and `vix` - middle `x`
      x = { 'x()x()x' },

      -- Whole buffer
      g = function()
        local from = { line = 1, col = 1 }
        local to = {
          line = vim.fn.line('$'),
          col = math.max(vim.fn.getline('$'):len(), 1)
        }
        return { from = from, to = to }
      end
    }
  })

  -- Use `vim.b.miniai_config` to customize per buffer
  -- Example of specification useful for Markdown files:
  local spec_pair = require('mini.ai').gen_spec.pair
  vim.b.miniai_config = {
    custom_textobjects = {
      ['*'] = spec_pair('*', '*', { type = 'greedy' }),
      ['_'] = spec_pair('_', '_', { type = 'greedy' }),
    },
  }

There are more example specifications in |MiniAi-textobject-specification|.

## Search method~

Value of `config.search_method` defines how best match search is done.
Based on its value, one of the following matches will be selected:
- Covering match. Left/right edge is before/after left/right edge of
  reference region.
- Previous match. Left/right edge is before left/right edge of reference
  region.
- Next match. Left/right edge is after left/right edge of reference region.
- Nearest match. Whichever is closest among previous and next matches.

Possible values are:
- `'cover'` - use only covering match. Don't use either previous or
  next; report that there is no textobject found.
- `'cover_or_next'` (default) - use covering match. If not found, use next.
- `'cover_or_prev'` - use covering match. If not found, use previous.
- `'cover_or_nearest'` - use covering match. If not found, use nearest.
- `'next'` - use next match.
- `'prev'` - use previous match.
- `'nearest'` - use nearest match.

Note: search is first performed on the reference region lines and only
after failure - on the whole neighborhood defined by `config.n_lines`. This
means that with `config.search_method` not equal to `'cover'`, "prev" or
"next" textobject will end up as search result if they are found on first
stage although covering match might be found in bigger, whole neighborhood.
This design is based on observation that most of the time operation is done
within reference region lines (usually cursor line).

Here is an example of what `a)` textobject is based on a value of
`'config.search_method'` when cursor is inside `bbb` word:
- `'cover'`:         `(a) bbb (c)` -> none
- `'cover_or_next'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(c)`
- `'cover_or_prev'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(a)`
- `'cover_or_nearest'`: depends on cursor position.
  For first and second `b` - as in `cover_or_prev` (as previous match is
  nearer), for third - as in `cover_or_next` (as next match is nearer).
- `'next'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(c)`. Same outcome for `(bbb)`.
- `'prev'`: `(a) bbb (c)` -> `(a)`. Same outcome for `(bbb)`.
- `'nearest'`: depends on cursor position (same as in `'cover_or_nearest'`).

## Mappings~

Mappings `around_next`/`inside_next` and `around_last`/`inside_last` are
essentially `around`/`inside` but using search method `'next'` and `'prev'`.

                                                      *MiniAi.find_textobject()*
               `MiniAi.find_textobject`({ai_type}, {id}, {opts})
Find textobject region

Parameters~
{ai_type} `(string)` One of `'a'` or `'i'`.
{id} `(string)` Single character string representing textobject id. It is
  used to get specification which is later used to compute textobject region.
  Note: if specification is a function, it is called with all present
  arguments (`opts` is populated with default arguments).
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <n_lines> - Number of lines within which textobject is searched.
    Default: `config.n_lines` (see |MiniAi.config|).
  - <n_times> - Number of times to perform a consecutive search. Each one
    is done with reference region being previous found textobject region.
    Default: 1.
  - <reference_region> - region to try to cover (see |MiniAi-glossary|). It
    is guaranteed that output region will not be inside or equal to this one.
    Default: empty region at cursor position.
  - <search_method> - Search method. Default: `config.search_method`.

Return~
`(table|nil)` Region of textobject or `nil` if no textobject different
  from `opts.reference_region` was consecutively found `opts.n_times` times.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *MiniAi.move_cursor()*
             `MiniAi.move_cursor`({side}, {ai_type}, {id}, {opts})
Move cursor to edge of textobject

Parameters~
{side} `(string)` One of `'left'` or `'right'`.
{ai_type} `(string)` One of `'a'` or `'i'`.
{id} `(string)` Single character string representing textobject id.
{opts} `(table|nil)` Same as in |MiniAi.find_textobject()|.
  `opts.n_times` means number of actual jumps (important when cursor
  already on the potential jump spot).

                                                               *MiniAi.gen_spec*
                               `MiniAi.gen_spec`
Generate common textobject specifications

This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get specification.

Example: >
  local gen_spec = require('mini.ai').gen_spec
  require('mini.ai').setup({
    custom_textobjects = {
      -- Tweak argument to be recognized only inside `()` between `;`
      a = gen_spec.argument({ brackets = { '%b()' }, separator = ';' }),

      -- Tweak function call to not detect dot in function name
      f = gen_spec.function_call({ name_pattern = '[%w_]' }),

      -- Function definition (needs treesitter queries with these captures)
      F = gen_spec.treesitter({ a = '@function.outer', i = '@function.inner' }),

      -- Make `|` select both edges in non-balanced way
      ['|'] = gen_spec.pair('|', '|', { type = 'non-balanced' }),
    }
  })

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *MiniAi.gen_spec.argument()*
                       `MiniAi.gen_spec.argument`({opts})
Argument specification

Argument textobject (has default `a` identifier) is a region inside
balanced bracket between allowed not excluded separators. Use this function
to tweak how it works.

Examples:
- `argument({ brackets = { '%b()' } })` will search for an argument only
  inside balanced `()`.
- `argument({ separator = '[,;]' })` will treat both `,` and `;` as separators.
- `argument({ exclude_regions = { '%b()' } })` will exclude separators
  which are inside balanced `()` (inside outer brackets).

Parameters~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Allowed fields:
  - <brackets> - array of patterns for outer balanced brackets.
    Default: `{ '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }` (any `()`, `[]`, or `{}` can
    enclose arguments).
  - <separator> - separator pattern. Default: `','`.
    One of the practical usages of this option is to include whitespace
    around character to be a part of separator. For example, `'%s*,%s*'`
    will treat as separator not only ',', but its possible surrounding
    whitespace. This has both positive and negative effects. On one hand,
    `daa` executed over the first argument will delete whitespace after
    first comma, leading to a more expected outcome. On the other hand it
    is ambiguous which argument is picked when cursor is over whitespace
    near the character separator.
  - <exclude_regions> - array with patterns for regions inside which
    separators will be ignored.
    Default: `{ '%b""', "%b''", '%b()', '%b[]', '%b{}' }` (separators
    inside balanced quotes or brackets are ignored).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *MiniAi.gen_spec.function_call()*
                    `MiniAi.gen_spec.function_call`({opts})
Function call specification

Function call textobject (has default `f` identifier) is a region with some
characters followed by balanced `()`. Use this function to tweak how it works.

Example:
- `function_call({ name_pattern = '[%w_]' })` will recognize function name with
  only alphanumeric or underscore (not dot).

Parameters~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Optsion. Allowed fields:
  - <name_pattern> - string pattern of character set allowed in function name.
    Default: `'[%w_%.]'` (alphanumeric, underscore, or dot).
    Note: should be enclosed in `[]`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *MiniAi.gen_spec.pair()*
                `MiniAi.gen_spec.pair`({left}, {right}, {opts})
Pair specification

Use it to define textobject for region surrounded with `left` from left and
`right` from right. The `a` textobject includes both edges, `i` - excludes them.

Region can be one of several types (controlled with `opts.type`). All
examples are for default search method, `a` textobject, and use `'_'` as
both `left` and `right`:
- Non-balanced (`{ type = 'non-balanced' }`), default. Equivalent to using
  `x.-y` as first pattern. Example: on line '_a_b_c_' it consecutively
  matches '_a_', '_b_', '_c_'.
- Balanced (`{ type = 'balanced' }`). Equivalent to using `%bxy` as first
  pattern. Example: on line '_a_b_c_' it consecutively matches '_a_', '_c_'.
  Note: both `left` and `right` should be single character.
- Greedy (`{ type = 'greedy' }`). Like non-balanced but will select maximum
  consecutive `left` and `right` edges. Example: on line '__a__b_' it
  consecutively selects '__a__' and '__b_'. Note: both `left` and `right`
  should be single character.

Parameters~
{left} `(string)` Left edge.
{right} `(string)` Right edge.
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <type> - Type of a pair. One of `'non-balanced'` (default), `'balanced'`,
  `'greedy'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter()*
              `MiniAi.gen_spec.treesitter`({ai_captures}, {opts})
Treesitter specification

This is a specification in function form. When called with a pair of
treesitter captures, it returns a specification function outputting an
array of regions that match corresponding (`a` or `i`) capture.

In order for this to work, apart from working treesitter parser for desired
language, user should have a reachable language-specific 'textobjects'
query (see |get_query()|). The most straightforward way for this is to have
'textobjects.scm' query file with treesitter captures stored in some
recognized path. This is primarily designed to be compatible with
'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects' plugin, but can be used
without it.

Two most common approaches for having a query file:
- Install 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects'. It has curated and
  well maintained builtin query files for many languages with a standardized
  capture names, like `function.outer`, `function.inner`, etc.
- Manually create file 'after/queries/<language name>/textobjects.scm' in
  your |$XDG_CONFIG_HOME| directory. It should contain queries with
  captures (later used to define textobjects). See |lua-treesitter-query|.
To verify that query file is reachable, run (example for "lua" language)
`:lua print(vim.inspect(vim.treesitter.query.get_files('lua', 'textobjects')))`
(output should have at least an intended file).

Example configuration for function definition textobject with
'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects' captures:
>
  local spec_treesitter = require('mini.ai').gen_spec.treesitter
  require('mini.ai').setup({
    custom_textobjects = {
      F = spec_treesitter({ a = '@function.outer', i = '@function.inner' }),
      o = spec_treesitter({
        a = { '@conditional.outer', '@loop.outer' },
        i = { '@conditional.inner', '@loop.inner' },
      })
    }
  })
>

Notes:
- By default query is done using 'nvim-treesitter' plugin if it is present
  (falls back to builtin methods otherwise). This allows for a more
  advanced features (like multiple buffer languages, custom directives, etc.).
  See `opts.use_nvim_treesitter` for how to disable this.
- It uses buffer's |filetype| to determine query language.
- On large files it is slower than pattern-based textobjects. Still very
  fast though (one search should be magnitude of milliseconds or tens of
  milliseconds on really large file).

Parameters~
{ai_captures} `(table)` Captures for `a` and `i` textobjects: table with
  <a> and <i> fields with captures for `a` and `i` textobjects respectively.
  Each value can be either a string capture (should start with `'@'`) or an
  array of such captures (best among all matches will be chosen).
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible values:
  - <use_nvim_treesitter> - whether to try to use 'nvim-treesitter' plugin
    (if present) to do the query. It implements more advanced behavior at
    cost of increased execution time. Provides more coherent experience if
    'nvim-treesitter-textobjects' queries are used. Default: `true`.

Return~
`(function)` Function with |MiniAi.find_textobject()| signature which
  returns array of current buffer regions representing matches for
  corresponding (`a` or `i`) treesitter capture.

See also~
|MiniAi-textobject-specification| for how this type of textobject
  specification is processed.
|get_query()| for how query is fetched in case of no 'nvim-treesitter'.
|Query:iter_captures()| for how all query captures are iterated in case of
  no 'nvim-treesitter'.
