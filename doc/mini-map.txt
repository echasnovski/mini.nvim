*mini.map* Window with buffer text overview
*MiniMap*

MIT License Copyright (c) 2022 Evgeni Chasnovski

==============================================================================

Features:
- Show and manage special floating window displaying automatically updated
  overview of current buffer text. Window takes up whole height of Neovim
  instance and is fixed to a left/right side. Map content is computed by
  taking all current lines, converting it to binary whitespace/non-whitespace
  mask, rescaling to appropriate dimensions, and converting back to strings
  consisting from special encoding symbols. All this is done **very fast** and
  **asynchronously**. See |MiniMap.open()|, |MiniMap.refresh()|, |MiniMap.close()|,
  |MiniMap.toggle()|, |MiniMap.toggle_side()|.
  For a general overview and tips, see |mini.map-usage|.

- Show scrollbar next to map content. It represents current line and view
  (top and bottom visible lines). Can be the only thing shown, making map
  window a "pure scrollbar". See "Pure scrollbar config" section in
  |MiniMap.config|.

- Highlight map lines representing certain data in current buffer. This is
  done via extensible set of callables, called integrations (see
  "Integrations" section in |MiniMap.config|). There are pre-built generators
  for common integrations:
    - Builtin search (as result of |/| and similar).
    - Builtin diagnostic (taken from |vim.diagnostic.get()|).
    - Git line status (with help of 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim', see
      |gitsigns.get_hunks()|).
  For more details see |MiniMap.gen_integration|.

- Focus on map window to quickly browse current (source) buffer. Moving inside
  map window updates cursor position in source window enabling fast and
  targeted buffer exploration. To focus back, hit `<CR>` to accept current
  explored position or `<Esc>` to go back to original position. See
  |MiniMap.toggle_focus()|.

- Customizable via |MiniMap.config| and/or `opts` argument of |MiniMap.open()|
  or |MiniMap.refresh()|:
    - Encoding symbols used to display binary information of different
      resolution (default is 3x2). There are pre-built generators for
      different basic character families and resolutions. See
      |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols|.
    - Scrollbar symbols, separate for line and view. Can have any width
      (even zero, which virtually disables scrollbar).
    - Integrations producing map line highlights.
    - Window options: side (left/right), width, 'winblend', and more.

What it doesn't do:
- Automatically refresh when typing in Insert mode. Although it can be done in
  non-blocking way, it still might introduce considerable computation overhead
  (especially in very large files).
- Has more flexible window configuration. In case a full height floating
  window obstructs vision of underlying buffers, use |MiniMap.toggle()| or
  |MiniMap.toggle_side()|. Works best with global statusline.
- Provide autoopen functionality. Due to vast differences in user preference
  of when map window should be shown, set up of automatic opening is left to
  user. A common approach would be to call `MiniMap.open()` on |VimEnter| event.
  If you use |MiniStarter|, you can modify `<CR>` buffer mapping: >

  vim.cmd([[autocmd User MiniStarterOpened
    \ lua vim.keymap.set(
    \   'n',
    \   '<CR>',
    \   '<Cmd>lua MiniStarter.eval_current_item(); MiniMap.open()<CR>',
    \   { buffer = true }
    \ )]])

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.map').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniMap`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniMap.*`).

See |MiniMap.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings (like `config.modifiers`) locally
to buffer inside `vim.b.minimap_config` which should have same structure
as `MiniMap.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Dependencies ~

Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality for integrations):
- Plugin 'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim' for Git status highlighting via
  |MiniMap.gen_integration.gitsigns()|. If missing, no highlighting is added.

# Comparisons ~

- 'wfxr/minimap.vim':
    - 'mini.map' doesn't have dependencies while being as fast as written
      in Rust dependency of 'minimap.vim'.
    - 'mini.map' uses floating window, while 'minimap.vim' uses regular one.
    - 'mini.map' provides slightly different visual interface with
      scrollbar and integration counts.
    - 'mini.map' allows encode symbols customization, 'minimap.vim' does not.
    - 'mini.map' allows extending highlight integrations, while only
      builtin search and git status are supported in 'minimap.vim'.
    - 'mini.map' updates in asynchronous (non-blocking) fashion, 'minimap.vim'
      does not.
    - 'mini.map' can be used as a pure scrollbar, 'minimap.vim' can not.
- 'dstein64/nvim-scrollview':
    - 'mini.map' has two-part scrollbar showing current line and view (with
      variable height), while 'nvim-scrollview' shows only current view
      (with fixed height).
    - 'nvim-scrollview' respects folds, i.e. shows view of visible lines,
      while 'mini.map' by design always shows view based on actual lines.
    - 'nvim-scrollview' creates scrollbar which can be dragged with mouse,
      while 'mini.nvim' does not, by design (use |MiniMap.toggle_focus()|).
    - 'mini.map' can show buffer outline, while 'nvim-scrollview' can not.
    - 'mini.map' can show highlight integrations, while 'nvim-scrollview'
      can not.
- 'petertriho/nvim-scrollbar':
    - 'mini.map' has two-part scrollbar showing current line and view (with
      variable height), while 'nvim-scrollbar' shows only current view.
    - 'mini.map' can show buffer outline, while 'nvim-scrollbar' can not.
    - 'mini.map' has fully extendable highlight integrations, while
      'nvim-scrollbar' only supports diagnostic and search (with dependency).
- 'lewis6991/satellite.nvim':
    - Almost the same differences as with 'dstein64/nvim-scrollview', except
      'satellite.nvim' can display some set of integration highlights.

# Highlight groups ~

* `MiniMapNormal` - basic highlight of whole window.
* `MiniMapSymbolCount` - counts of per-line integration items.
* `MiniMapSymbolLine` - scrollbar part representing current line.
* `MiniMapSymbolView` - scrollbar part representing current view.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling ~

To disable, set `vim.g.minimap_disable` (globally) or `vim.b.minimap_disable`
(for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number of different scenarios
and customization intentions, writing exact rules for disabling module's
functionality is left to user. See |mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common
recipes.

# Mappings ~

This module doesn't make mappings, only provides functions for users to map
manually. Here is how one |<Leader>| set of mappings can be constructed: >

  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mc', MiniMap.close)
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mf', MiniMap.toggle_focus)
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mo', MiniMap.open)
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mr', MiniMap.refresh)
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>ms', MiniMap.toggle_side)
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>mt', MiniMap.toggle)
<
# How automatic refresh works ~

Automatic refresh is done by calling |MiniMap.refresh()| when appropriate
|events| occur. It is done with specially chosen `parts` argument value (to
avoid unnecessary computations). For example, when only cursor has moved
(|CursorMoved|), only scrollbar is updated; so no recomputation of integrations
or line encoding is done.

To avoid visual clutter, automatic refresh is done only in normal buffers
and help pages (i.e. with |buftype| being empty or "help")

When you think content is not up to date, try one of these:
- Call |MiniMap.refresh()| manually. Make mapping to make it easier.
- Save current buffer, for example with |:write|.
- Exit and enter Normal mode (if your Neovim version supports |ModeChanged|).

# Options ~

## Symbols ~

Options in `config.symbols` define characters used to display various
information in map window.

### Encode symbols ~

The `config.symbols.encode` option defines which characters are used to
encode source buffer lines. For details of encode algorithm, see
|MiniMap.encode_strings()|.

This option should be a table with the following structure:
- <resolution> field - table containing <row> and <col> elements with row
  and column resolution of each symbol. This defines encoding structure and
  number of needed encode symbols.
- Numerical fields 1, 2, ..., 2^(row_resolution * col_resolution). Each symbol
  represents a `(row_resolution, col_resolution)` boolean mask (`true` for
  non-whitespace, `false` for whitespace), created as (reversed) binary digit:
  `true` as 1; `false` as 0. Traversing left-right, top-bottom (top-left is
  lowest bit, bottom-right - highest). So first symbol encodes a complete
  whitespace, last - complete non-whitespace.

If `nil` (default), output of |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()| with `'3x2'`
identifier is used.

Example: { '1', '2', '3', '4', resolution = { row = 1, col = 2 } }. This
will encode two characters in each input row. So a string `'  a  aaa'` will
be encoded as `'1234'`.

There are pre-built generators of encode symbols:
- |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()|
- |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.dot()|
- |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.shade()|

### Scrollbar symbols ~

Options `config.symbols.scroll_line` and `config.symbols.scroll_view` define
strings used to represent current line and current view inside map window.
Can have any length, map window content will adjust.

If supplied window width is small enough so that only (part of) of
scrollbar can be shown, it is called a "pure scrollbar". The behavior differs
slightly from normal map window. See "Pure scrollbar config" later section.

Some suggestions for scrollbar symbols:
- View-line pairs: '▒' and '█'.
- Line - '🮚', '▶'.
- View - '╎', '┋', '┋'.

## Integrations ~

Option `config.integrations` is an array of integrations. Each one is used
to define map line highlights representing some important lines in source
buffer. If `nil` (default), no integrations are used.

Each integration should be a callable returning an array with data about
**source buffer** lines it wants to highlight. Each array element should be
a table with <line> (source buffer line number) and <hl_group> (string with
highlight group name) keys. Note: line number outside of source buffer
count will be converted to a nearest appropriate one.

Example output of single integration: >

  {
    { line = 1, hl_group = 'Search' },
    { line = 2, hl_group = 'Operator' },
    { line = 9, hl_group = 'Search'}
  }
<
Conversion to map highlights is done on a "first seen" basis: actual
highlight group applied to a map line is taken from the first integration
output convertible to that map line. Other outputs with same map line
(after conversion) contribute to integration count shown between scrollbar
and encoded lines (if `config.window.show_integration_count` is `true`).

Previous example output with default `'3x2'` resolution will add |hl-Search|
highlight on map lines 1 and 3, and show integration count 2 on first line.

Every element of integrations array is called one by one from start to end
with their outputs appended to end of single array. This means that more
important integrations should be placed in the beginning of an array, as
this will make them have higher priority in case other integrations will
highlight same map line.

Example of using `config.integrations`: >

  local map = require('mini.map')
  map.setup({
    integrations = {
      map.gen_integration.builtin_search(),
      map.gen_integration.gitsigns(),
      map.gen_integration.diagnostic(),
    },
  })
<
## Window config ~

Option `config.window` defines some properties of map window.

`window.focusable` - whether to allow focusing on map window with other
methods beside |MiniMap.toggle_focus()| (like |wincmd|, |CTRL-W|, or
mouse). Default: `false`.

`window.side` - which side to stick map window: `'left'` or `'right'` (default).

`window.show_integration_count` - whether to show integration count between
scrollbar and encoded lines. Integration count is a number of integration
outputs which were converted to same map line. When `true`, adds single
cell column with numbers from 2 to 9 and character '+' indicating count
greater than 9. Count 1 is not shown, because it is redundant to highlighted
map line. Default: `true`.

`window.width` - width of floating window, including scrollbar and
integration count column. Default: 10.

`window.winblend` - value of 'winblend' of floating window. Value 0 makes it
completely non-transparent, 100 - completely transparent (content is still
visible, but with slightly different highlights).

`window.zindex` - z-index of floating window. Default: 10.

# Pure scrollbar config ~

"Pure scrollbar" is a configuration when window width is not enough to show
encoded content. It has following differences from default "map" approach:
- It doesn't perform line encoding with |MiniMap.encode_strings()|
  but instead uses encoding with fixed number of lines (equal to window
  height).
- Integration highlights are not computed.

Config: >

  require('mini.map').setup({
    -- Customize `symbols` to your liking

    window = {
      -- Set this to the maximum width of your scroll symbols
      width = 1,

      -- Set this to your liking. Try values 0, 25, 50, 75, 100
      winblend = 100,

      -- Don't need extra column
      show_integration_count = false,
    }
  })

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *MiniMap.current*
                               `MiniMap.current`
Table with information about current state of map

At least these keys are supported:
- <buf_data> - table with buffer identifiers. Field <map> contains
  identifier of a buffer used to display map. Field <source> - buffer
  identifier which content map is displaying (i.e. source buffer).
- <win_data> - table of window identifiers used to display map in certain
  tabpage. Keys: tabpage identifier. Values: window identifier.
- <opts> - current options used to control map display. Same structure
  as |MiniMap.config|. Takes precedence over global and buffer-local configs.
  Is reset when last map window is closed with |MiniMap.close()|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *MiniMap.encode_strings()*
                  `MiniMap.encode_strings`({strings}, {opts})
Encode strings

This takes arbitrary array of strings and computes its non-whitespace
outline. Output is an array of strings with configurable array length, string
width, and symbols representing encoding.

Each encode symbol is assumed to have resolution within which it can convey
binary information. For example, resolution `3x2` (row resolution 3,
column - 2) means that each symbol can encode 3 rows and 2 columns of
binary data. Here it is used to encode non-whitespace mask. See more in
"Encode symbols" section of |MiniMap.config|.

Encoding has the following steps:
- Convert strings to boolean mask: 2d boolean array with each row
  representing a string. Element in every row subarray is `true` if
  respective (possibly multibyte) character in a string is not a whitespace,
  `false` otherwise. Note: tabs are expanded into 'tabstop' spaces.
- Rescale to appropriate dimensions:
    - Each output dimension is just enough to encode all input strings, but
      not more than supplied dimensions (`opts.n_rows * resolution.row` and
      `opts.n_cols * resolution.col` respectively).
    - If input dimensions are too big to fit inside output, perform grid
      downscaling with loss of information. Input boolean mask is divided
      into 2d-bins with as equal as possible dimensions. Each bin then
      converted into single boolean value: `true` if bin contains at least
      one `true` element, `false` otherwise. This leads to a whitespace
      output meaning that **all** entries in a bin are whitespace, while
      non-whitespace output means that **some** entry is non-whitespace.
- Convert boolean mask to symbol strings:
    - Input rescaled boolean mask is divided into bins with dimensions of
      symbol resolution (assuming `false` outer padding).
    - Each bin with resolution dimensions is transformed into encode symbol.
      Single convertible `(resolution.row, resolution.col)` boolean
      mask is treated as (reversed) binary digit: `true` as 1; `false` as 0.
      Traversing left-right, top-bottom (top-left is lowest bit,
      bottom-right - highest).

Example ~

Assume the output should have 3 rows of symbols each with width 2. Encode
symbols are ' ', '▌', '▐', '█' with `1x2` resolution.

Assume input strings: >
  aaaaa
   b b

   d d
  e e
<
Steps:
- Convert to boolean mask (each row is a boolean array, "t"/"f" ~ `true`/`false`,
  empty spots are equivalent to being `false`): >
  ttttt
  ftft

  ftft
  tft
<
- Rescale. Output dimensions are `n_rows * resolution.row = 3 * 1 = 3` rows and
  `n_cols * resolution.col = 2 * 2 = 4`. It creates as equal as possible grid
  with 3 rows and 4 columns and converts bins to single booleans. Result: >
  tttt
  tftf
  ttff
- Convert to symbols. It makes `1x2` bins, treats their input as (reversed)
  binary digits (`ff=00=0`, `tf=10=1`, `ft=01=2`, `tt=11=3`) and takes
  corresponding symbols from supplied options (value plus 1). Result: >
  ██
  ▌▌
  █

Parameters ~
{strings} `(table)` Array of arbitrary strings.
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <n_rows> - number of rows in output encoding. If too big, will be
    truncated to be maximum needed to encode all input strings (taking into
    account symbols row resolution). Default: `math.huge`.
  - <n_cols> - width of every encoding string. If too big, will be truncated
    to be maximum needed to encode all input strings (taking into account
    symbols column resolution). Default: `math.huge`.
  - <symbols> - array of symbols with extra `resolution` field. See "Encode
    symbols" section of |MiniMap.config| for more details. Default: output
    of |MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()| with `'3x2'` identifier.

Return ~
`(table)` Array of encoded strings.

                                                                *MiniMap.open()*
                             `MiniMap.open`({opts})
Open map window

This creates and shows map window in current tabpage. It basically has
two steps:
- If not already done, create map buffer (used to set lines and other
  visual indicators) and map window.
- Call |MiniMap.refresh()|.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options used to define map configuration. Same structure
  as |MiniMap.config|. Will have effect until at least one tabpage has opened
  map window. Default values are taken in the following order:
  - From `opts` field of |MiniMap.current|.
  - From `vim.b.minimap_config`.
  - From |MiniMap.config|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *MiniMap.refresh()*
                       `MiniMap.refresh`({opts}, {parts})
Refresh map window

This function serves two purposes:
- Update current map configuration via `opts`.
- Update parts of displayed content via `parts`.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options used to define map configuration. Same structure
  as |MiniMap.config|. Will have effect until at least one tabpage has opened
  map window. Default values are taken in the following order:
  - From `opts` field of |MiniMap.current|.
  - From `vim.b.minimap_config`.
  - From |MiniMap.config|.
{parts} `(table|nil)` Which parts to update. Recognised keys with boolean
  values (all `true` by default):
  - <integrations> - whether to update integration highlights.
  - <lines> - whether to update map lines.
  - <scrollbar> - whether to update scrollbar.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *MiniMap.close()*
                               `MiniMap.close`()
Close map window

Also resets `opts` field of |MiniMap.current| after closing last map window
(among possibly several tabpages).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniMap.toggle()*
                            `MiniMap.toggle`({opts})
Toggle map window

Open if not shown in current tabpage, close otherwise.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Input for |MiniMap.open()|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *MiniMap.toggle_focus()*
                 `MiniMap.toggle_focus`({use_previous_cursor})
Toggle focus to/from map window

When not inside map window, put cursor inside map window; otherwise put
cursor in previous window with source buffer.

When cursor is moving inside map window (but not just after focusing), view of
source window is updated to show first line convertible to current map line.
This allows quick targeted source buffer exploration.

There are at least these extra methods to focus back from map window:
- Press `<CR>` to accept current explored position in source buffer.
  Equivalent to calling this function with `false` argument.
- Press `<Esc>` to go back to original position prior focusing on map window.
  Equivalent to calling this function with `true` argument.

Parameters ~
{use_previous_cursor} `(boolean|nil)` Whether to focus on source window at
  original cursor position (the one prior focusing on map window).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                         *MiniMap.toggle_side()*
                            `MiniMap.toggle_side`()
Toggle side of map window

A small convenience wrapper for calling |MiniMap.refresh()| to change the
side of map window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols*
                          `MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols`
Generate encode symbols

This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get encode symbols.

Each element takes a string resolution identifier of a form `'rxc'` (like `'3x2'`)
where `r` is a row resolution of each symbol (how many rows of binary data it
can encode) and `c` is a column resolution (how many columns it can encode).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block()*
                    `MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.block`({id})
Generate block encode symbols

Outputs use solid block to encode binary data. Example: '🬗', '▟', '█'.

Parameters ~
{id} `(string)` Resolution identifier.
  Available values: `'1x2'`, `'2x1'`, `'2x2'`, `'3x2'` (default in 'mini.map').

                                              *MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.dot()*
                     `MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.dot`({id})
Generate dot encode symbols

Outputs use dots to encode binary data. Example: '⡪', '⣼', '⣿'.

Parameters ~
{id} `(string)` Resolution identifier. Available values: `'4x2'`, `'3x2'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.shade()*
                    `MiniMap.gen_encode_symbols.shade`({id})
Generate shade encode symbols

Outputs use whole cell shades to encode binary data. They use same set of
characters ('░', '▒', '▒', '▓), but with different resolution.

Parameters ~
{id} `(string)` Resolution identifier. Available values: `'1x2'`, `'2x1'`.

                                                       *MiniMap.gen_integration*
                           `MiniMap.gen_integration`
Generate integrations

This is a table with function elements. Call to actually get encode symbols.

Each element takes a table defining highlight groups used for to highlight
map lines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                      *MiniMap.gen_integration.builtin_search()*
             `MiniMap.gen_integration.builtin_search`({hl_groups})
Builtin search

Highlight lines with matches of current builtin search (like with |/|, |?|, etc.).
Integration count reflects number of actual matches.

It prompts integration highlighting update on every change of |hlsearch| option
(see |OptionSet|). Note, that it doesn't do that when search is
started with |n|, |N|, or similar (there is no good approach for this yet).
To enable highlight update on this keys, make custom mappings. Like this: >

  for _, key in ipairs({ 'n', 'N', '*', '#' }) do
    vim.keymap.set(
      'n',
      key,
      key ..
        '<Cmd>lua MiniMap.refresh({}, {lines = false, scrollbar = false})<CR>'
    )
  end
<
Parameters ~
{hl_groups} `(table|nil)` Table defining highlight groups. Can have the
  following fields:
  - <search> - highlight group for search matches. Default: |hl-Search|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          *MiniMap.gen_integration.diagnostic()*
               `MiniMap.gen_integration.diagnostic`({hl_groups})
Builtin diagnostic

Highlight lines with matches of current diagnostic items. Items are computed
with |vim.diagnostic.get()| for current (source) buffer.

It prompts integration highlighting update on every |DiagnosticChanged| event.
Diagnostic items with higher severity (see |vim.diagnostic.severity|) have
higher highlight priority (errors will be shown over all others, etc.).

Parameters ~
{hl_groups} `(table|nil)` Table defining highlight groups. Supplied fields
  also define which diagnostic severity to highlight.
  Can have the following fields:
  - <error> - highlight group for error items.
    Default: |hl-DiagnosticFloatingError|.
  - <warn> - highlight group for warning items. Default: `nil` (not shown).
  - <info> - highlight group for info items. Default: `nil` (not shown).
  - <hint> - highlight group for hint items. Default: `nil` (not shown).

Usage ~
Show all diagnostic levels: >
  local map = require('mini.map')
  local diagnostic_integration = map.gen_integration.diagnostic({
    error = 'DiagnosticFloatingError',
    warn  = 'DiagnosticFloatingWarn',
    info  = 'DiagnosticFloatingInfo',
    hint  = 'DiagnosticFloatingHint',
  })
  map.setup({ integrations = { diagnostic_integration } })

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *MiniMap.gen_integration.gitsigns()*
                `MiniMap.gen_integration.gitsigns`({hl_groups})
Git line status

Highlight lines which have non-trivial Git status. Requires dependency
'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim' installed and set up. Uses |gitsigns.get_hunks()|
and should highlight map lines similarly to how Gitsigns highlights source
buffer lines (except dealing with rescaled input on "first seen" bases; see
"Integrations" section in |MiniMap.config|).

It prompts integration highlighting update on every |gitsigns-event|.

Parameters ~
{hl_groups} `(table|nil)` Table defining highlight groups. If `nil` (not
  supplied), this status is not highlighted. Can have the following fields:
  - <add> - highlight group for added lines. Default: "GitSignsAdd".
  - <change> - highlight group for changed lines. Default: "GitSignsChange".
  - <delete> - highlight group for deleted lines. Default: "GitSignsDelete".
