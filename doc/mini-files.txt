*mini.files* Navigate and manipulate file system
*MiniFiles*

MIT License Copyright (c) 2023 Evgeni Chasnovski

==============================================================================

Features:
- Navigate file system using column view (Miller columns) to display nested
  directories. See |MiniFiles-navigation| for overview.

- Opt-in preview of file or directory under cursor.

- Manipulate files and directories by editing text buffers: create, delete,
  copy, rename, move. See |MiniFiles-manipulation| for overview.

- Use as default file explorer instead of |netrw|.

- Configurable:
    - Filter/prefix/sort of file system entries.
    - Mappings used for common explorer actions.
    - UI options: whether to show preview of file/directory under cursor, etc.

What it doesn't do:
- Try to be replacement of system file explorer. It is mostly designed to
  be used within Neovim to quickly explore file system structure, open
  files, and perform some quick file system edits.

- Work on remote locations. Only local file system is supported.

- Provide built-in interactive toggle of content `filter` and `sort`.
  See |MiniFiles-examples| for some common examples.

- Provide out of the box extra information like git or diagnostic status.
  This can be achieved by setting |extmarks| on appropriate event(s)
  (see |MiniFiles-events|)

Notes:
- This module is written and thoroughly tested on Linux. Support for other
  platform/OS (like Windows or MacOS) is a goal, but there is no guarantee.

- Works on all supported versions but using Neovim>=0.9 is recommended.

- This module silently reacts to not enough permissions:
    - In case of missing file, check its or its parent read permissions.
    - In case of no manipulation result, check write permissions.

# Dependencies ~

Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality, will work without them):
- Plugin 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for filetype icons near the entry
  name. If missing, default icons will be used.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.files').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniFiles`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniFiles.*`).

See |MiniFiles.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings (like mappings or window options)
locally to buffer inside `vim.b.minifiles_config` which should have same
structure as `MiniFiles.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for
more details.

# Comparisons ~

- 'nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua':
    - Provides tree view of file system, while this module uses column view.
    - File system manipulation is done with custom set of mappings for each
      action, while this module is designed to do that by editing text.
    - Has more out of the box functionality with extra configuration, while
      this module has not (by design).

- 'stevearc/oil.nvim':
    - Uses single window to show information only about currently explored
      directory, while this module uses column view to show whole currently
      explored branch.
    - Also uses text editing to manipulate file system entries.
    - Can work for remote file systems, while this module can not (by design).

- 'nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim':
    - Compares to this module mostly the same as 'nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua'.

# Highlight groups ~

* `MiniFilesBorder` - border of regular windows.
* `MiniFilesBorderModified` - border of windows showing modified buffer.
* `MiniFilesCursorLine` - cursor line in explorer windows.
* `MiniFilesDirectory` - text and icon representing directory.
* `MiniFilesFile` - text representing file.
* `MiniFilesNormal` - basic foreground/background highlighting.
* `MiniFilesTitle` - title of regular windows.
* `MiniFilesTitleFocused` - title of focused window.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling ~

This plugin provides only manually started functionality, so no disabling
is available.

                                                          *MiniFiles-navigation*
Navigation ~

Every navigation starts by calling |MiniFiles.open()|, either directly or via
mapping (see its help for examples of some common scenarios). It will show
an explorer consisting of side-by-side floating windows with the following
principles:

- Explorer shows one branch of nested directories at a time.

- Explorer consists from several windows:

    - Each window displays entries of a single directory in a modifiable
      scratch buffer.

    - Windows are organized left to right: for any particular window the left
      neighbor is its parent directory and right neighbor - its child.

- Explorer windows are the viewport to some part of current branch, meaning
  that their opening/closing does not affect the branch. This matters, for
  example, if there are more elements in the branch than can be shown windows.

- Every buffer line represents separate file system entry following certain
  format (not visible for users by default; set |conceallevel| to 0 to see it)

- Once directory is shown, its buffer is not updated automatically following
  external file system changes. Manually use |MiniFiles.synchronize()| for that.

After opening explorer, in-buffer navigation is done the same way as any
regular buffer, except without some keys reserved for built-in actions.

Most common ways to navigate are:

- Press `j` to move cursor onto next (lower) entry in current directory.
- Press `k` to move cursor onto previous (higher) entry in current directory.
- Press `l` to expand entry under cursor (see "Go in" action).
- Press `h` to focus on parent directory (see "Go out" action).

Cursor positions in each directory buffer are tracked and saved during
navigation. This allows for more convenient repeated navigation to some
previously visited branch.

Available built-in actions (see "Details" for more information): >

Details:

- "Go in":
    - Always opens file in the latest window before `MiniFiles.open()` call.
    - Never closes explorer.
    - Works in linewise Visual mode to expand multiple entries.

- "Go in plus" is regular "Go in" but closes explorer after opening a file.

- "Go out plus" is regular "Go out" but trims right part of branch.

- "Reset" focuses only on "anchor" directory (the one used to open current
  explorer) and resets all stored directory cursor positions.

- "Reveal cwd" extends branch to include |current-directory|.
  If it is not an ancestor of the current branch, nothing is done.

- "Show help" results into new window with helpful information about current
  explorer. Press `q` to close it.

- "Synchronize" parses user edits in directory buffers, applies them (after
  confirmation), and updates all directory buffers with the most relevant
  file system information. Can also be used without user edits to show up
  to date file system entries.
  See |MiniFiles-manipulation| for more info about file system manipulation.

- "Trim left" and "Trim right" trim parts of the whole branch, not only its
  currently visible parts.

Notes:

- Each action has exported function with more details about it.

- Keys can be configured with `mappings` table of |MiniFiles.config|.

                                                        *MiniFiles-manipulation*
Manipulation ~

File system manipulation is done by editing text inside directory buffers,
which are shown inside dedicated window(s). See |MiniFiles-navigation| for
more information about navigating to a particular directory.

General workflow:

- Navigate to the directory in which manipulation should be done.

- Edit buffer in the way representing file system action.

- Repeat previous steps until all necessary file system actions are recorded.
  Note: even if directory buffer is hidden, its modifications are preserved,
  so you can navigate in and out of directory with modified buffer.

- Execute |MiniFiles.synchronize()| (default key is `=`). This will prompt
  confirmation dialog listing all file system actions it is about to perform.
  READ IT CAREFULLY.

- Confirm by pressing `y`/`<CR>` (applies edits and updates buffers) or
  don't confirm by pressing `n`/`<Esc>` (updates buffers without applying edits).

# How does it work ~

All manipulation functionality is powered by creating and keeping track of
path indexes: text of the form `/xxx` (`xxx` is the number path index) placed
at the start of every line representing file system entry.

By default they are hidden as concealed text (along with prefix separators)
for more convenience but you can see them by setting |conceallevel| to 0.
DO NOT modify text to the left of entry name.

During synchronization, actual text for entry name is compared to path index
at that line (if present) to deduce which file system action to perform.

# Supported file system actions ~

## Create ~

- Create file by creating new line with file name (including extension).

- Create directory by creating new line with directory name followed by `/`.

- Create file or directory inside nested directories by creating new line
  with text like 'dir/nested-dir/' or 'dir/nested-dir/file'.
  Always use `/` on any OS.

## Delete ~

- Delete file or directory by deleting **whole line** describing it.

- If `options.permanent_delete` is `true`, delete is permanent. Otherwise
  file system entry is moved to a module-specific trash directory
  (see |MiniFiles.config| for more details).

## Rename ~

- Rename file or directory by editing its name (not icon or path index to
  the left of it).

- With default mappings for `h`/`l` it might be not convenient to rename
  only part of an entry. You can adopt any of the following approaches:
    - Use different motions, like |$|, |e|, |f|, etc.
    - Go into Insert mode and navigate inside it.
    - Change mappings to be more suited for manipulation and not navigation.
      See "Mappings" section in |MiniFiles.config|.

- It is not needed to end directory name with `/`.

- Cyclic renames ('a' to 'b' and 'b' to 'a') are not supported.

## Copy ~

- Copy file or directory by copying **whole line** describing it and pasting
  it inside buffer of target directory.

- Change of target path is allowed. Edit only entry name in target location
  (not icon or path index to the left of it).

- Copying inside same parent directory is supported only if target path has
  different name.

- Copying inside child directory is supported.

## Move ~

- Move file or directory by cutting **whole line** describing it and then
  pasting it inside target directory.

- Change of target path is allowed. Edit only entry name in target location
  (not icon or path index to the left of it).

- Moving directory inside itself is not supported.

                                                              *MiniFiles-events*
Events ~

To allow user customization and integration of external tools, certain |User|
autocommand events are triggered under common circumstances.

UI events ~

- `MiniFilesBufferCreate` - when buffer is created to show a particular
  directory. Triggered once per directory during one explorer session.
  Can be used to create buffer-local mappings.

- `MiniFilesBufferUpdate` - when directory buffer is updated with new content.
  Can be used for integrations to set |extmarks| with useful information.

- `MiniFilesWindowOpen` - when new window is opened. Can be used to set
  window-local settings (like border, 'winblend', etc.)

- `MiniFilesWindowUpdate` - when a window is updated. Triggers frequently,
  for example, for every "go in" or "go out" action.

Callback for each UI event will receive `data` field (see |nvim_create_autocmd()|)
with the following information:

- <buf_id> - index of target buffer.
- <win_id> - index of target window. Can be `nil`, like in
  `MiniFilesBufferCreate` and buffer's first `MiniFilesBufferUpdate` as
  they are triggered before window is created.

File action events ~

- `MiniFilesActionCreate` - after entry is successfully created.

- `MiniFilesActionDelete` - after entry is successfully deleted.

- `MiniFilesActionRename` - after entry is successfully renamed.

- `MiniFilesActionCopy` - after entry is successfully copied.

- `MiniFilesActionMove` - after entry is successfully moved.

Callback for each file action event will receive `data` field
(see |nvim_create_autocmd()|) with the following information:

- <action> - string with action name.
- <from> - absolute path of entry before action (`nil` for "create" action).
- <to> - absolute path of entry after action (`nil` for "delete" action).

Common configuration examples ~

# Toggle explorer ~

Use a combination of |MiniFiles.open()| and |MiniFiles.close()|: >

  local minifiles_toggle = function(...)
    if not MiniFiles.close() then MiniFiles.open(...) end
  end

# Customize windows ~

Create an autocommand for `MiniFilesWindowOpen` event: >

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
    pattern = 'MiniFilesWindowOpen',
    callback = function(args)
      local win_id = args.data.win_id

      -- Customize window-local settings
      vim.wo[win_id].winblend = 50
      vim.api.nvim_win_set_config(win_id, { border = 'double' })
    end,
  })

# Customize icons ~

Use different directory icon: >

  local my_prefix = function(fs_entry)
    if fs_entry.fs_type == 'directory' then
      -- NOTE: it is usually a good idea to use icon followed by space
      return ' ', 'MiniFilesDirectory'
    end
    return MiniFiles.default_prefix(fs_entry)
  end

  require('mini.files').setup({ content = { prefix = my_prefix } })

Show no icons: >

  require('mini.files').setup({ content = { prefix = function() end } })

# Create mapping to show/hide dot-files ~

Create an autocommand for `MiniFilesBufferCreate` event which calls
|MiniFiles.refresh()| with explicit `content.filter` functions: >

  local show_dotfiles = true

  local filter_show = function(fs_entry) return true end

  local filter_hide = function(fs_entry)
    return not vim.startswith(fs_entry.name, '.')
  end

  local toggle_dotfiles = function()
    show_dotfiles = not show_dotfiles
    local new_filter = show_dotfiles and filter_show or filter_hide
    MiniFiles.refresh({ content = { filter = new_filter } })
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
    pattern = 'MiniFilesBufferCreate',
    callback = function(args)
      local buf_id = args.data.buf_id
      -- Tweak left-hand side of mapping to your liking
      vim.keymap.set('n', 'g.', toggle_dotfiles, { buffer = buf_id })
    end,
  })

# Create mappings to modify target window via split ~

Combine |MiniFiles.get_target_window()| and |MiniFiles.set_target_window()|: >

  local map_split = function(buf_id, lhs, direction)
    local rhs = function()
      -- Make new window and set it as target
      local new_target_window
      vim.api.nvim_win_call(MiniFiles.get_target_window(), function()
        vim.cmd(direction .. ' split')
        new_target_window = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
      end)

      MiniFiles.set_target_window(new_target_window)
    end

    -- Adding `desc` will result into `show_help` entries
    local desc = 'Split ' .. direction
    vim.keymap.set('n', lhs, rhs, { buffer = buf_id, desc = desc })
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
    pattern = 'MiniFilesBufferCreate',
    callback = function(args)
      local buf_id = args.data.buf_id
      -- Tweak keys to your liking
      map_split(buf_id, 'gs', 'belowright horizontal')
      map_split(buf_id, 'gv', 'belowright vertical')
    end,
  })

# Create mapping to set current working directory ~

Use |MiniFiles.get_fs_entry()| together with |vim.fs.dirname()|: >

  local files_set_cwd = function(path)
    -- Works only if cursor is on the valid file system entry
    local cur_entry_path = MiniFiles.get_fs_entry().path
    local cur_directory = vim.fs.dirname(cur_entry_path)
    vim.fn.chdir(cur_directory)
  end

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('User', {
    pattern = 'MiniFilesBufferCreate',
    callback = function(args)
      vim.keymap.set('n', 'g~', files_set_cwd, { buffer = args.data.buf_id })
    end,
  })

# Content ~

`content.filter` is a predicate which takes file system entry data as input
and returns `true`-ish value if it should be shown.
Uses |MiniFiles.default_filter()| by default.

A file system entry data is a table with the following fields:
  - <fs_type> `(string)` - one of "file" or "directory".
  - <name> `(string)` - basename of an entry (including extension).
  - <path> `(string)` - full path of an entry.

`content.prefix` describes what text (prefix) to show to the left of file
system entry name (if any) and how to highlight it. It also takes file
system entry data as input and returns tuple of text and highlight group
name to be used to highlight prefix. See |MiniFiles-examples| for common
examples of how to use it.
Note: due to how lines are parsed to detect user edits for file system
manipulation, output of `content.prefix` should not contain `/` character.
Uses |MiniFiles.default_prefix()| by default.

`content.sort` describes in which order directory entries should be shown
in directory buffer. Takes as input and returns as output an array of file
system entry data. Note: technically, it can be used to filter and modify
its elements as well.
Uses |MiniFiles.default_sort()| by default.

# Mappings ~

`mappings` table can be used to customize buffer-local mappings created in each
directory buffer for built-in actions. Entry name corresponds to the function
name of the action, value - right hand side of the mapping. Supply empty
string to not create a particular mapping.

Default mappings are mostly designed for consistent navigation experience.
Here are some alternatives: >

  -- Close explorer after opening file with `l`
  mappings = {
    go_in = 'L',
    go_in_plus = 'l',
  }

  -- Don't use `h`/`l` for easier cursor navigation during text edit
  mappings = {
    go_in = 'L',
    go_in_plus = '',
    go_out = 'H',
    go_out_plus = '',
  }

# Options ~

`options.use_as_default_explorer` is a boolean indicating whether this module
should be used as a default file explorer for editing directories (instead of
|netrw| by default).

`options.permanent_delete` is a boolean indicating whether to perform
permanent delete or move into special trash directory.
This is a module-specific variant of "remove to trash".
Target directory is 'mini.files/trash' inside standard path of Neovim data
directory (execute `:echo stdpath('data')` to see its path in your case).

# Windows ~

`windows.max_number` is a maximum number of windows allowed to be open
simultaneously. For example, use value 1 to always show single window.
There is no constraint by default.

`windows.preview` is a boolean indicating whether to show preview of
file/directory under cursor. Note: it is shown with highlighting if Neovim
version is sufficient and file is small enough (less than 1K bytes per line
or 1M bytes in total).

`windows.width_focus` and `windows.width_nofocus` are number of columns used
as `width` for focused and non-focused windows respectively.

                                                              *MiniFiles.open()*
                 `MiniFiles.open`({path}, {use_latest}, {opts})
Open file explorer

Common ways to use this function:

- `MiniFiles.open()` - open current working directory in a last used state.

- `MiniFiles.open(nil, false)` - fresh explorer in current working directory.

- `MiniFiles.open(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0))` - open directory of current
  file (in a last used state) with focus on that file.

- `MiniFiles.open(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0), false)` - fresh explorer in
  directory of current file.

- `MiniFiles.open(MiniFiles.get_latest_path())` - open last used `path`
  (per tabpage). Current working directory for the first time.

Parameters ~
{path} `(string|nil)` A valid file system path used as anchor.
  If it is a path to directory, used directly.
  If it is a path to file, its parent directory is used as anchor while
  explorer will focus on the supplied file.
  Default: path of |current-directory|.
{use_latest} `(boolean|nil)` Whether to load explorer state from history
  (based on the supplied anchor path). Default: `true`.
{opts} `(table|nil)` Table of options overriding |MiniFiles.config| and
  `vim.b.minifiles_config` for this particular explorer session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *MiniFiles.refresh()*
                          `MiniFiles.refresh`({opts})
Refresh explorer

Notes:
- If in `opts` at least one of `content` entry is not `nil`, all directory
  buffers are forced to update.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Table of options to update.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *MiniFiles.synchronize()*
                           `MiniFiles.synchronize`()
Synchronize explorer

- Parse user edits in directory buffers.
- Convert edits to file system actions and apply them after confirmation.
- Update all directory buffers with the most relevant file system information.
  Can be used without user edits to account for external file system changes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *MiniFiles.reset()*
                              `MiniFiles.reset`()
Reset explorer

- Show single window focused on anchor directory (which was used as first
  argument for |MiniFiles.open()|).
- Reset all tracked directory cursors to point at first entry.
