==============================================================================

Jump within visible lines via iterative label filtering.

Features:
- Make jump by iterative filtering of possible, equally considered jump
  spots until there is only one. Filtering is done by typing a label
  character that is visualized at jump spot.

- Customizable (see |MiniJump2d.config|):
    - Way of computing possible jump spots with opinionated default.
    - Characters used to label jump spots during iterative filtering.
    - Visual effects: how many steps ahead to show; dim lines with spots.
    - Action hooks to be executed at certain events during jump.
    - Allowed windows: current and/or not current.
    - Allowed lines: whether to process blank or folded lines, lines
      before/at/after cursor line, etc. Example: user can configure to look
      for spots only inside current window at or after cursor line.
    Example: user can configure to look for word starts only inside current
    window at or after cursor line with 'j' and 'k' labels performing some
    action after jump.

- Works in Visual and Operator-pending (with dot-repeat) modes.

- Preconfigured ways of computing jump spots (see |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|).

- Works with multibyte characters.

General overview of how jump is intended to be performed:
- Lock eyes on desired location ("spot") recognizable by future jump.
  Should be within visible lines at place where cursor can be placed.

- Initiate jump. Either by custom keybinding or with a call to
  |MiniJump2d.start()| (allows customization options). This will highlight
  all possible jump spots with their labels (letters from "a" to "z" by
  default). For more details, read |MiniJump2d.start()| and |MiniJump2d.config|.

- Type character that appeared over desired location. If its label was
  unique, jump is performed. If it wasn't unique, possible jump spots are
  filtered to those having the same label character.

- Repeat previous step until there is only one possible jump spot or type `<CR>`
  to jump to first available jump spot. Typing anything else stops jumping
   without moving cursor.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.jump2d').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
`MiniJump2d` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
`:lua MiniJump2d.*`).

See |MiniJump2d.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minijump2d_config` which should have same structure as
`MiniJump2d.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

To stop module from showing non-error feedback, set `config.silent = true`.

# Example usage ~

- Modify default jumping to use only current window at or after cursor line: >
  require('mini.jump2d').setup({
    allowed_lines = { cursor_before = false },
    allowed_windows = { not_current = false },
  })
- `lua MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.line_start)` - jump to word
  start using combination of options supplied in |MiniJump2d.config| and
  |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.line_start|.
- `lua MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.single_character)` - jump
  to single character typed after executing this command.
- See more examples in |MiniJump2d.start| and |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|.

# Comparisons ~

- 'phaazon/hop.nvim':
    - Both are fast, customizable, and extensible (user can write their own
      ways to define jump spots).
    - 'hop.nvim' visualizes all steps at once. While this module can show
      configurable number of steps ahead.
    - Both have several builtin ways to specify type of jump (word start,
      line start, one character or query based on user input). 'hop.nvim'
      does that by exporting many targeted Neovim commands, while this
      module has preconfigured basic options leaving others to
      customization with Lua code (see |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts|).
    - 'hop.nvim' computes labels (called "hints") differently. Contrary to
      this module deliberately not having preference of one jump spot over
      another, 'hop.nvim' uses specialized algorithm that produces sequence
      of keys in a slightly biased manner: some sequences are intentionally
      shorter than the others (leading to fewer average keystrokes). They
      are put near cursor (by default) and highlighted differently. Final
      order of sequences is based on distance to the cursor.
    - 'mini.jump2d' has opinionated default algorithm of computing jump
      spots. See |MiniJump2d.default_spotter|.

# Highlight groups ~

* `MiniJump2dSpot` - highlighting of jump spot's next step. By default it
  uses label with highest contrast while not being too visually demanding:
  white on black for dark 'background', black on white for light. If it
  doesn't suit your liking, try couple of these alternatives (or choose
  your own, of course):
    - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=reverse` - reverse underlying highlighting (more
      colorful while being visible in any colorscheme).
    - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=bold,italic` - bold italic.
    - `hi MiniJump2dSpot gui=undercurl guisp=red` - red undercurl.

* `MiniJump2dSpotUnique` - highlighting of jump spot's next step if it has
  unique label. By default links to `MiniJump2dSpot`.

* `MiniJump2dSpotAhead` - highlighting of jump spot's future steps. By default
  similar to `MiniJump2dSpot` but with less contrast and visibility.

* `MiniJump2dDim` - highlighting of lines with at least one jump spot.
  Make it non-bright in order for jump spot labels to be more visible.
  By default linked to `Comment` highlight group.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling ~

To disable, set `vim.g.minijump2d_disable` (globally) or
`vim.b.minijump2d_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high
number of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact
rules for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
|mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

# Options ~

## Spotter function ~

Actual computation of possible jump spots is done through spotter function.
It should have the following arguments:
- `line_num` is a line number inside buffer.
- `args` - table with additional arguments:
    - {win_id} - identifier of a window where input line number is from.
    - {win_id_init} - identifier of a window which was current when
      `MiniJump2d.start()` was called.

Its output is a list of byte-indexed positions that should be considered as
possible jump spots for this particular line in this particular window.
Note: for a more aligned visualization this list should be (but not
strictly necessary) sorted increasingly.

Note: spotter function is always called with `win_id` window being
"temporary current" (see |nvim_win_call|). This allows using builtin
Vimscript functions that operate only inside current window.

## View ~

Option `view.n_steps_ahead` controls how many steps ahead to show along
with the currently required label. Those future steps are showed with
different (less visible) highlight group ("MiniJump2dSpotAhead"). Usually
it is a good idea to use this with a spotter which doesn't result into many
jump spots (like, for example, |MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.word_start|).
Default is 0 to not show anything ahead as it reduces visual noise.

Option `view.dim` controls whether to dim lines with at least one jump spot.
Dimming is done by applying "MiniJump2dDim" highlight group to the whol line.

## Allowed lines ~

Option `allowed_lines` controls which lines will be used for computing
possible jump spots:
- If `blank` or `fold` is `true`, it is possible to jump to first column of blank
  line (determined by |prevnonblank|) or first folded one (determined by
  |foldclosed|) respectively. Otherwise they are skipped. These lines are
  not processed by spotter function even if the option is `true`.
- If `cursor_before`, (`cursor_at`, `cursor_after`) is `true`, lines before
  (at, after) cursor line of all processed windows are forwarded to spotter
  function. Otherwise, they don't. This allows control of jump "direction".

## Hooks ~

Following hook functions can be used to further tweak jumping experience:
- `before_start` - called without arguments first thing when jump starts.
  One of the possible use cases is to ask for user input and update spotter
  function with it.
- `after_jump` - called after jump was actually done. Useful to make
  post-adjustments (like move cursor to first non-whitespace character).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            *MiniJump2d.start()*
                           `MiniJump2d.start`({opts})
Start jumping

Compute possible jump spots, visualize them and wait for iterative filtering.

First computation of possible jump spots ~

- Process allowed windows (current and/or not current; controlled by
  `allowed_windows` option) by visible lines from top to bottom. For each
  one see if it is allowed (controlled by `allowed_lines` option). If not
  allowed, then do nothing. If allowed and should be processed by
  `spotter`, process it.
- Apply spotter function from `spotter` option for each appropriate line
  and concatenate outputs. This means that eventual order of jump spots
  aligns with lexicographical order within "window id" - "line number" -
  "position in `spotter` output" tuples.
- For each possible jump compute its label: a single character from
  `labels` option used to filter jump spots. Each possible label character
  might be used more than once to label several "consecutive" jump spots.
  It is done in an optimal way under assumption of no preference of one
  spot over another. Basically, it means "use all labels at each step of
  iterative filtering as equally as possible".

Visualization ~

Current label for each possible jump spot is shown at that position
overriding everything underneath it.

Iterative filtering ~

Labels of possible jump spots are computed in order to use them as equally
as possible.

Example:
- With `abc` as `labels` option, initial labels for 10 possible jumps
  are "aaaabbbccc". As there are 10 spots which should be "coded" with 3
  symbols, at least 2 symbols need 3 steps to filter them out. With current
  implementation those are always the "first ones".
- After typing `a`, it filters first four jump spots and recomputes its
  labels to be "aabc".
- After typing `a` again, it filters first two spots and recomputes its
  labels to be "ab".
- After typing either `a` or `b` it filters single spot and makes jump.

With default 26 labels for most real-world cases 2 steps is enough for
default spotter function. Rarely 3 steps are needed with several windows.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Configuration of jumping, overriding global and buffer
  local values.config|. Has the same structure as |MiniJump2d.config|
  without <mappings> field. Extra allowed fields:
    - <hl_group> - which highlight group to use for first step.
      Default: "MiniJump2dSpot".
    - <hl_group_ahead> - which highlight group to use for second step and later.
      Default: "MiniJump2dSpotAhead".
    - <hl_group_dim> - which highlight group to use dimming used lines.
      Default: "MiniJump2dSpotDim".

Usage ~
- Start default jumping:
  `MiniJump2d.start()`
- Jump to word start:
  `MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.word_start)`
- Jump to single character from user input (follow by typing one character):
  `MiniJump2d.start(MiniJump2d.builtin_opts.single_character)`
- Jump to first character of punctuation group only inside current window
  which is placed at cursor line; visualize with 'hl-Search': >
  MiniJump2d.start({
    spotter = MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('%p+'),
    allowed_lines = { cursor_before = false, cursor_after = false },
    allowed_windows = { not_current = false },
    hl_group = 'Search'
  })

              `MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter`({pattern}, {side})
Generate spotter for Lua pattern

Parameters ~
{pattern} `(string|nil)` Lua pattern. Default: `'[^%s%p]+'` which matches group
  of "non-whitespace non-punctuation characters" (basically a way of saying
  "group of alphanumeric characters" that works with multibyte characters).
{side} `(string|nil)` Which side of pattern match should be considered as
  jumping spot. Should be one of 'start' (start of match, default), 'end'
  (inclusive end of match), or 'none' (match for spot is done manually
  inside pattern with plain `()` matching group).

Return ~
`(function)` Spotter function.

Usage ~
- Match any punctuation:
  `MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('%p')`
- Match first from line start non-whitespace character:
  `MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('^%s*%S', 'end')`
- Match start of last word:
  `MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('[^%s%p]+[%s%p]-$', 'start')`
- Match letter followed by another letter (example of manual matching
  inside pattern):
  `MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('%a()%a', 'none')`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                *MiniJump2d.gen_union_spotter()*
                     `MiniJump2d.gen_union_spotter`({...})
Generate union of spotters

Parameters ~
{...} `(any)` Each argument should be a valid spotter.
  See |MiniJump2d.config| for more details.

Return ~
`(function)` Spotter producing union of spots.

Usage ~
- Match start and end of non-blank character groups: >

  local nonblank_start = MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('%S+', 'start')
  local nonblank_end = MiniJump2d.gen_pattern_spotter('%S+', 'end')
  local spotter = MiniJump2d.gen_union_spotter(nonblank_start, nonblank_end)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *MiniJump2d.default_spotter*
                          `MiniJump2d.default_spotter`
Default spotter function

Spot is possible for jump if it is one of the following:
- Start or end of non-whitespace character group.
- Alphanumeric character followed or preceded by punctuation (useful for
  snake case names).
- Start of uppercase character group (useful for camel case names). Usually
  only Latin alphabet is recognized due to Lua patterns shortcomings.

These rules are derived in an attempt to balance between two intentions:
- Allow as much useful jumping spots as possible.
- Make labeled jump spots easily distinguishable.

Usually takes from 2 to 3 keystrokes to get to destination.
