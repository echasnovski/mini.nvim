*mini.icons* Icon provider
*MiniIcons*

==============================================================================

Features:

- Provide icons with their highlighting via a single |MiniIcons.get()| for
  various categories: filetype, file/directory path, extension, operating
  system, LSP kind values. Icons and category defaults can be overridden.

- Configurable styles: "glyph" (icon glyphs) or "ascii" (non-glyph fallback).

- Fixed set of highlight groups (linked to built-in groups by default) for
  better blend with color scheme.

- Caching for maximum performance.

- Integration with |vim.filetype.add()| and |vim.filetype.match()|.

- Mocking methods of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for better integrations
  with plugins outside 'mini.nvim'. See |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()|.

- Tweaking built-in maps for "LSP kind" to include icons. In particular, this
  makes |mini.completion| use icons in LSP step. See |MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind()|.

Notes:

- It is not a goal to become a collection of icons for as much use cases as
  possible. There are specific criteria for icon data to be included as
  built-in in each category (see |MiniIcons.get()|).
  The main supported category is "filetype".

Recommendations for plugin authors using 'mini.icons' as a dependency:

- Check if `_G.MiniIcons` table is present (which means that user explicitly
  enabled 'mini.icons') and provide icons only if it is.

- Use |MiniIcons.get()| function to get icon string and more data about it.

- For file icons prefer using full path instead of relative or only basename.
  It makes a difference if path matches pattern that uses parent directories.
  The |MiniIcons.config| has an example of that.

# Dependencies ~

Suggested dependencies:

- Terminal emulator that supports showing special utf8 glyphs, possibly with
  "overflow" view (displaying is done not in one but two visual cells).
  Most modern feature-rich terminal emulators support this out of the box:
  WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm2, Ghostty.
  Not having "overflow" feature only results into smaller icons.
  Not having support for special utf8 glyphs will result into seemingly
  random symbols (or question mark squares) instead of icon glyphs.

- Font that supports Nerd Fonts (https://www.nerdfonts.com) icons from
  version 3.0.0+ (in particular `nf-md-*` class).
  This should be configured on terminal emulator level either by using font
  patched with Nerd Fonts icons or using `NerdFontsSymbolsOnly` font as
  a fallback for glyphs that are not supported in main font.

If using terminal emulator and/or font with icon support is impossible, use
`config.style = 'ascii'`. It will use a (less visually appealing) set of
non-glyph icons.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.icons').setup({})` (replace `{}`
with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniIcons` which you
can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniIcons.*`).

See |MiniIcons.config| for `config` structure and default values.

# Comparisons ~

- 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' (for users):
    - Sets individual colors to each icon with separate specific highlight
      groups, while this modules uses fixed set of highlight groups.
      This makes it easier to customize in bulk and actually blend with any
      color scheme.

    - This module prefers richer set of `nf-md-*` (from "Material design" set)
      Nerd Fonts icons while 'nvim-web-devicons' mostly prefers `nf-dev-*`
      (from "devicons" set).

    - Supported categories are slightly different (with much overlap).

    - Both support customization of any icon. Only this module supports
      customization of default ones per supported category.

    - Using this module can occasionally result in small delays when used
      synchronously for many times to get icons for not typical files (like
      in |mini.files|). This is due to using |vim.filetype.match()| fallback and
      is present only during first call, as value is cached for later uses.

    - This module supports different icon styles (like "ascii" for when using
      glyphs is not possible), while 'nvim-web-devicons' does not.

    - This module provides |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()| function which
      when called imitates installed 'nvim-web-devicons' plugin to support
      other plugins which do not provide 'mini.icons' yet.

- 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' (for plugin developers):
    - Both have main "get icon" type of function:
        - Both return tuple of icon and highlight group strings.

        - This module always returns icon data possibly falling back to
          user's configured default, while 'nvim-web-devicons' is able to
          return `nil`. This module's approach is more aligned with the most
          common use case of always showing an icon instead or near some data.
          There is a third returned value indicating if output is a result of
          a fallback (see |MiniIcons.get()|).

        - This module uses |vim.filetype.match()| as a fallback for "file"
          and "extension" categories, while 'nvim-web-devicons' completely
          relies on the manually maintained tables of supported filenames
          and extensions.
          Using fallback results in a wider support and deeper integration
          with Neovim's filetype detection at the cost of occasional slower
          first call. The difference is reduced as much as is reasonable by
          preferring faster file extension resolution over filetype matching.

        - This module caches all its return values resulting in really fast
          next same argument calls, while 'nvim-web-devicons' doesn't do that.

        - This module works with full file/directory paths as input.

    - Different sets of supported categories (see |MiniIcons.config|):
        - Both support "file", "extension", "filetype", "operating system".
          Albeit in different volumes: 'nvim-web-devicons' covers more
          cases for "operating system", while this module has better eventual
          coverage for other cases.

        - This module supports "directory" and "lsp" categories.

        - 'nvim-web-devicons' covers "desktop environment" and "window
          management" categories. This modules does not include them due to
          relatively low demand.

- 'onsails/lspkind.nvim':
    - Provides icons only for `CompletionItemKind`, while this module also has
      icons for `SymbolKind` and other non-LSP categories.
    - Provides dedicated formatting function for 'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp' while this
      module intentionally does not (adding icons should be straightforward
      to manually implement while anything else is out of scope).

# Highlight groups ~

Only the following set of highlight groups is used as icon highlight.
It is recommended that they all only define colored foreground:

* `MiniIconsAzure`  - azure.
* `MiniIconsBlue`   - blue.
* `MiniIconsCyan`   - cyan.
* `MiniIconsGreen`  - green.
* `MiniIconsGrey`   - grey.
* `MiniIconsOrange` - orange.
* `MiniIconsPurple` - purple.
* `MiniIconsRed`    - red.
* `MiniIconsYellow` - yellow.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

                          `MiniIcons.setup`({config})
Module setup

Parameters ~
{config} `(table|nil)` Module config table. See |MiniIcons.config|.

Usage ~
>lua
  require('mini.icons').setup() -- use default config
  -- OR
  require('mini.icons').setup({}) -- replace {} with your config table
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniIcons.config*
                               `MiniIcons.config`
Module config

Default values:
>lua
  MiniIcons.config = {
    -- Icon style: 'glyph' or 'ascii'
    style = 'glyph',

    -- Customize per category. See `:h MiniIcons.config` for details.
    default   = {},
    directory = {},
    extension = {},
    file      = {},
    filetype  = {},
    lsp       = {},
    os        = {},

    -- Control which extensions will be considered during "file" resolution
    use_file_extension = function(ext, file) return true end,
  }
<
# Style ~

`config.style` is a string defining which icon style to use. It can be:
- `'glyph'` (default) - use glyph icons (like 󰈔 and 󰉋 ).
- `'ascii'` - use fallback ASCII-compatible icons. Those are computed as
  an upper first character of the icon's resolved name inside its category.
  Examples: >lua

    MiniIcons.get('file', 'Makefile') -- Has `'M'` as icon
    MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon
    MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon; it is resolved to
                                      -- come from 'lua' 'extension' category
    MiniIcons.get('file', 'myfile')   -- Has `'F'` as icon; it is resolved to
                                      -- come from 'file' 'default' category
<
# Customization per category ~

The following entries can be used to customize icons for supported categories:
- `config.default`
- `config.directory`
- `config.extension`
- `config.file`
- `config.filetype`
- `config.lsp`
- `config.os`

Customization should be done by supplying a table with <glyph> (icon glyph)
and/or <hl> (name of highlight group) string fields as a value for an icon
name entry. Example: >lua

  require('mini.icons').setup({
    default = {
      -- Override default glyph for "file" category (reuse highlight group)
      file = { glyph = '󰈤' },
    },
    extension = {
      -- Override highlight group (not necessary from 'mini.icons')
      lua = { hl = 'Special' },

      -- Add icons for custom extension. This will also be used in
      -- 'file' category for input like 'file.my.ext'.
      ['my.ext'] = { glyph = '󰻲', hl = 'MiniIconsRed' },
    },
  })
<
Notes:
- These customizations only take effect inside |MiniIcons.setup()| call.
  Changing interactively via `:lua MiniIcons.config.xxx = { ... }` does not work
  for performance reasons.
- Use lower case names for categories which are matched ignoring case.
  See |MiniIcons.get()| for more details.

# Using extension during file resolution ~

`config.use_file_extension` is a function which can be used to control which
extensions will be considered as a source of icon data during "file" category
resolution (see |MiniIcons.get()| for more details).
Default: function which always returns `true` (i.e. consider all extensions).

Will be called once for the biggest suffix after dot found in the file name.
The arguments will be `ext` (found extension; lowercase) and `file` (input for
which icon is computed; as is). Should explicitly return `true` if `ext` is to
be considered (i.e. call `MiniIcons.get('extension', ext)` and use its
output if it is not default). Otherwise extension won't be even considered.

The primary use case for this setting is to ensure that some extensions are
ignored in order for resolution to reach |vim.filetype.match()| stage. This
is needed if there is a set up filetype detection for files with recognizable
extension and conflicting icons (which you want to use). Note: if problematic
filetype detection involves only known in advance file names, prefer using
`config.file` customization.

Example: >lua

  -- Built-in filetype detection recognizes files like "queries/.*%.scm"
  -- as "query" filetype. However, without special setup, 'mini.icons' will
  -- use "scm" extension to resolve as Scheme file. Here is a setup to ignore
  -- "scm" extension and completely rely on `vim.filetype.match()` fallback.
  require('mini.icons').setup({
    -- Check last letters explicitly to account for dots in file name
    use_file_extension = function(ext) return ext:sub(-3) ~= 'scm' end
  })

  -- Another common choices for extensions to ignore: "yml", "json", "txt".

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *MiniIcons.get()*
                      `MiniIcons.get`({category}, {name})
Get icon data

Usage example: >lua

  -- Results into `icon='󰢱'`, `hl='MiniIconsAzure'`, `is_default=false`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua')
<
Notes:
- Always returns some data, even if icon name is not explicitly supported
  within target category. Category "default" is used as a fallback. Use third
  output value to check if this particular case is a result of a fallback.

- Glyphs are explicitly preferred (when reasonable) from a richer set of
  `nf-md-*` class  ("Material design" set) of Nerd Fonts icons.

- Output is cached after the first call to increase performance of next calls
  with same arguments. To reset cache, call |MiniIcons.setup()|.

- To increase first call performance for "extension" and "file" categories,
  add frequently used values in |MiniIcons.config|. They will be preferred
  over executing |vim.filetype.match()|.

- Matching icon name for "file" and "directory" categories is done exactly
  and respecting case. Others are done ignoring case.

Parameters ~
{category} `(string)` Category name. Supported categories:
  - `'default'` - icon data used as fallback for any category.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any supported category name.
      - <Built-in>: only supported category names.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('default', 'file')
<
  - `'directory'` - icon data for directory path.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string, but only basename is used. Works with not present
        paths (no check is done).
      - <Built-in>: popular directory names not tied to language/software
        (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.).

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '.config')
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '~/.config')
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '/home/user/.config')

      -- Results in different output
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '.Config')
<
  - `'extension'` - icon data for extension.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string (without extra dot prefix).
      - <Built-in>: popular extensions without associated filetype plus a set
        for which filetype detection gives not good enough result.

    Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
      - List of user configured and built-in extensions (for better results).
        Run `:=MiniIcons.list('extension')` to see them.
        Used also if present as suffix after the dot (widest one preferred).
      - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()| with placeholder
        file name. Uses icon data from "filetype" category.

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua')
      MiniIcons.get('extension', 'LUA')
      MiniIcons.get('extension', 'my.lua')
<
  - `'file'` - icon data for file path.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string. Works with not present paths (no check is done).
      - <Built-in>: popular file names not tied to language/software
        (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.) plus a set which
        has recognizable extension but has special detectable filetype.

    Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
      - List of user configured and built-in file names (matched to basename
        of the input exactly). Run `:=MiniIcons.list('file')` to see them.
      - Basename extension:
          - Matched directly as `get('extension', ext)`, where `ext` is the
            widest suffix after the dot.
          - Considered only if `config.use_file_extension` returned `true`.
          - Only recognizable extensions (i.e. not default fallback) are used.
      - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()| with full input (not
        basename) as `filename`. Uses icon data from "filetype" category.

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', '~/.config/nvim/init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', '/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua')

      -- Results in different output
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'Init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.LUA')

      -- Respects full path input in `vim.filetype.match()`
      MiniIcons.get('file', '.git/info/attributes')
<
  - `'filetype'` - icon data for 'filetype' values.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: any filetype that is reasonably used in Neovim ecosystem.
        This category is intended as a widest net for supporting use cases.
        Users are encouraged to have a specific filetype detection set up.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'lua')
      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'help')
      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'minifiles')
<
  - `'lsp'` - icon data for various "LSP kind" values.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: only namesspace entries from LSP specification that are
        can be displayed to user. Like `CompletionItemKind`, `SymbolKind`, etc.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'array')
      MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'keyword')
<
  - `'os'` - icon data for popular operating systems.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: only operating systems which have `nf-md-*` class icon.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('os', 'linux')
      MiniIcons.get('os', 'arch')
      MiniIcons.get('os', 'macos')
<
{name} `(string)` Icon name within category. Use |MiniIcons.list()| to get icon
  names which are explicitly supported for specific category.

Return ~
`(...)` Tuple of icon string, highlight group name it is suggested to be
  highlighted with, and boolean indicating whether this icon was returned
  as a result of fallback to default. Example: >lua

  -- Results into `icon='󰢱'`, `hl='MiniIconsAzure'`, `is_default=false`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua')

  -- Results into `icon='󰈔'`, `hl='MiniIconsGrey'`, `is_default=true`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'not-supported')
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniIcons.list()*
                          `MiniIcons.list`({category})
List explicitly supported icon names

Parameters ~
{category} `(string)` Category name supported by |MiniIcons.get()|.

Return ~
`(table)` Array of icon names which are explicitly supported for category.
  Note, that `'file'` and `'extension'` categories support much more icon names
  via their fallback to using |vim.filetype.match()| with `'filetype'` category.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()*
                      `MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons`()
Mock 'nvim-web-devicons' module

Call this function to mock exported functions of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons'
plugin. It will mock all its functions which return icon data by
using |MiniIcons.get()| equivalent.

This function is useful if any plugins relevant to you depend solely on
'nvim-web-devicons' and have not yet added an integration with 'mini.icons'.

Full example of usage: >lua

  require('mini.icons').setup()
  MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()
<
Works without installed 'nvim-web-devicons' and even with it installed (needs
to be called after 'nvim-web-devicons' is set up).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind()*
                       `MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind`({mode})
Tweak built-in LSP kind names

Update in place appropriate maps in |vim.lsp.protocol| (`CompletionItemKind`
and `SymbolKind`) by using icon strings from "lsp" category. Only "numeric
id to kind name" part is updated (to preserve data from original map).

Updating is done in one of these modes:
- Append:  add icon after text.
- Prepend: add icon before text (default).
- Replace: use icon instead of text.

Notes:
- Makes |mini.completion| show icons, as it uses built-in protocol map.
- Results in loading whole `vim.lsp` module, so might add significant amount
  of time on startup. Call it lazily. For example, with |MiniDeps.later()|: >

    require('mini.icons').setup()
    MiniDeps.later(MiniIcons.tweak_lsp_kind)
<
Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of "prepend" (default), "append", "replace".
