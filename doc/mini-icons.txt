*mini.icons* Icon provider
*MiniIcons*

==============================================================================

Features:

- Provide icons with their highlighting via a single |MiniIcons.get()| for
  various categories: filetype, file/directory path, extension, operating
  system, LSP kind values. Icons and category defaults can be overridden.

- Configurable styles: "glyph" (icon glyphs) or "ascii" (non-glyph fallback).

- Fixed set of highlight groups (linked to built-in groups by default) for
  better blend with color scheme.

- Caching for maximum performance.

- Integration with |vim.filetype.add()| and |vim.filetype.match()|.

- Mocking methods of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for better integrations
  with plugins outside 'mini.nvim'. See |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()|.

Notes:

- It is not a goal to become a collection of icons for as much use cases as
  possible. There are specific criteria for icon data to be included as
  built-in in each category (see |MiniIcons.get()|).
  The main supported category is "filetype".

# Dependencies ~

Suggested dependencies:

- Terminal emulator that supports showing special utf8 glyphs, possibly with
  "overflow" view (displaying is done not in one but two visual cells).
  Most modern feature-rich terminal emulators support this out of the box:
  WezTerm, Kitty, Alacritty, iTerm2, Ghostty.
  Not having "overflow" feature only results into smaller icons.
  Not having support for special utf8 glyphs will result into seemingly
  random symbols (or question mark squares) instead of icon glyphs.

- Font that supports Nerd Fonts (https://www.nerdfonts.com) icons from
  version 3.0.0+ (in particular `nf-md-*` class).
  This should be configured on terminal emulator level either by using font
  patched with Nerd Fonts icons or using `NerdFontsSymbolsOnly` font as
  a fallback for glyphs that are not supported in main font.

If using terminal emulator and/or font with icon support is impossible, use
`config.style = 'ascii'`. It will use a (less visually appealing) set of
non-glyph icons.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.icons').setup({})` (replace `{}`
with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniIcons` which you
can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniIcons.*`).

See |MiniIcons.config| for `config` structure and default values.

# Comparisons ~

- 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' (for users):
    - Sets individual colors to each icon with separate specific highlight
      groups, while this modules uses fixed set of highlight groups.
      This makes it easier to customize in bulk and actually blend with any
      color scheme.

    - This module prefers richer set of `nf-md-*` (from "Material design" set)
      Nerd Fonts icons while 'nvim-web-devicons' mostly prefers `nf-dev-*`
      (from "devicons" set).

    - Supported categories are slightly different (with much overlap).

    - Both support customization of any icon. Only this module supports
      customization of default ones per supported category.

    - Using this module can occasionally result in small delays when used
      synchronously for many times to get icons for not typical files (like
      in |mini.files|). This is due to using |vim.filetype.match()| fallback and
      is present only during first call, as value is cached for later uses.

    - This module supports different icon styles (like "ascii" for when using
      glyphs is not possible), while 'nvim-web-devicons' does not.

    - This module provides |MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()| function which
      when called imitates installed 'nvim-web-devicons' plugin to support
      other plugins which do not provide 'mini.icons' yet.

- 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' (for plugin developers):
    - Both have main "get icon" type of function:
        - Both return tuple of icon and highlight group strings.

        - This module always returns icon data possibly falling back to
          user's configured default, while 'nvim-web-devicons' is able to
          return `nil`. This module's approach is more aligned with the most
          common use case of always showing an icon instead or near some data.
          There is a third returned value indicating if output is a result of
          a fallback (see |MiniIcons.get()|).

        - This module uses |vim.filetype.match()| as a fallback for "file"
          and "extension" categories, while 'nvim-web-devicons' completely
          relies on the manually maintained tables of supported filenames
          and extensions.
          Using fallback results in a wider support and deeper integration
          with Neovim's filetype detection at the cost of occasional slower
          first call. The difference is reduced as much as is reasonable by
          also having some manually tracked data tables for common cases.

        - This module caches all its return values resulting in really fast
          next same argument calls, while 'nvim-web-devicons' doesn't do that.

        - This module works with full file/directory paths as input.

    - Different sets of supported categories (see |MiniIcons.config|):
        - Both support "file", "extension", "filetype", "operating system".
          Albeit in different volumes: 'nvim-web-devicons' covers more
          cases for "operating system", while this module has better eventual
          coverage for other cases.


        - This module supports "directory" and "lsp" categories.

        - 'nvim-web-devicons' covers "desktop environment" and "window
          management" categories. This modules does not include them due to
          relatively low demand.

# Highlight groups ~

Only the following set of highlight groups is used as icon highlight.
It is recommended that they all only define colored foreground:

* `MiniIconsAzure`  - azure.
* `MiniIconsBlue`   - blue.
* `MiniIconsCyan`   - cyan.
* `MiniIconsGreen`  - green.
* `MiniIconsGrey`   - grey.
* `MiniIconsOrange` - orange.
* `MiniIconsPurple` - purple.
* `MiniIconsRed`    - red.
* `MiniIconsYellow` - yellow.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

                          `MiniIcons.setup`({config})
Module setup

Parameters ~
{config} `(table|nil)` Module config table. See |MiniIcons.config|.

Usage ~
>lua
  require('mini.icons').setup() -- use default config
  -- OR
  require('mini.icons').setup({}) -- replace {} with your config table
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniIcons.config*
                               `MiniIcons.config`
Module config

Default values:
>lua
  MiniIcons.config = {
    -- Icon style: 'glyph' or 'ascii'
    style = 'glyph',

    -- Customize per category. See `:h MiniIcons.config` for details.
    default   = {},
    directory = {},
    extension = {},
    file      = {},
    filetype  = {},
    lsp       = {},
    os        = {},
  }
<
# Style ~

`config.style` is a string defining which icon style to use. It can be:
- `'glyph'` (default) - use glyph icons (like 󰈔 and 󰉋 ).
- `'ascii'` - use fallback ASCII-compatible icons. Those are computed as
  an upper first character of the icon's resolved name inside its category.
  Examples: >lua

    MiniIcons.get('file', 'Makefile') -- Has `'M'` as icon
    MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon
    MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua') -- Has `'L'` as icon; it is resolved to
                                      -- come from 'lua' 'extension' category
    MiniIcons.get('file', 'myfile')   -- Has `'F'` as icon; it is resolved to
                                      -- come from 'file' 'default' category
<
# Customization per category ~

The following entries can be used to customize icons for supported categories:
- `config.default`
- `config.directory`
- `config.extension`
- `config.file`
- `config.filetype`
- `config.lsp`
- `config.os`

Customization should be done by supplying a table with <glyph> (icon glyph)
and/or <hl> (name of highlight group) string fields as a value for an icon
name entry. Example: >lua

  require('mini.icons').setup({
    default = {
      -- Override default glyph for "file" category (reuse highlight group)
      file = { glyph = '󰈤' },
    },
    extension = {
      -- Override highlight group (not necessary from 'mini.icons')
      lua = { hl = 'Special' },

      -- Add icons for custom extension. This will also be used in
      -- 'file' category for input like 'file.my.ext'.
      ['my.ext'] = { glyph = '󰻲', hl = 'MiniIconsRed' },
    },
  })
<
Notes:
- These customizations only take effect inside |MiniIcons.setup()| call.
  Changing interactively via `:lua MiniIcons.config.xxx = { ... }` does not work
  for performance reasons.
- Use lower case names for categories which are matched ignoring case.
  See |MiniIcons.get()| for more details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *MiniIcons.get()*
                      `MiniIcons.get`({category}, {name})
Get icon data

Usage example: >lua

  -- Results into `icon='󰢱'`, `hl='MiniIconsAzure'`, `is_default=false`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua')
<
Notes:
- Always returns some data, even if icon name is not explicitly supported
  within target category. Category "default" is used as a fallback. Use third
  output value to check if this particular case is a result of a fallback.

- Glyphs are explicitly preferred (when reasonable) from a richer set of
  `nf-md-*` class  ("Material design" set) of Nerd Fonts icons.

- Output is cached after the first call to increase performance of next calls
  with same arguments. To reset cache, call |MiniIcons.setup()|.

- To increase first call performance for "extension" and "file" categories,
  add frequently used values in |MiniIcons.config|. They will be preferred
  over executing |vim.filetype.match()|.

- Matching icon name for "file" and "directory" categories is done exactly
  and respecting case. Others are done ignoring case.

- The recommended way to use this function in plugin is first checking if
  `_G.MiniIcons` table is present (which means that user explicitly enabled
  'mini.icons') and provide icons only if it is.

Parameters ~
{category} `(string)` Category name. Supported categories:
  - `'default'` - icon data used as fallback for any category.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any supported category name.
      - <Built-in>: only supported category names.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('default', 'file')
<
  - `'directory'` - icon data for directory path.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string, but only basename is used. Works with not present
        paths (no check is done).
      - <Built-in>: popular directory names not tied to language/software
        (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.).

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '.config')
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '~/.config')
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '/home/user/.config')

      -- Results in different output
      MiniIcons.get('directory', '.Config')
<
  - `'extension'` - icon data for extension.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string (without extra dot prefix).
      - <Built-in>: popular extensions not tied to language/software (with
        few notable exceptions) and without associated filetype; plus a set
        of filetype associated extensions (for performance or better support).

    Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
      - List of built-in and user configured extensions (for better
        performance). Run `:=MiniIcons.list('extension')` to see them.
      - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()| with placeholder
        file name. Uses output of corresponding "filetype" category.

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('extension', 'lua')
      MiniIcons.get('extension', 'LUA')
<
  - `'file'` - icon data for file path.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string, but only basename is used. Works with not present
        paths (no check is done).
      - <Built-in>: popular file names not tied to language/software
        (with few notable exceptions like Neovim, Git, etc.).

    Icon data is attempted to be resolved in the following order:
      - List of built-in and user configured file names (to match exactly).
        Run `:=MiniIcons.list('flle')` to see them.
      - List of built-in and user configured extensions.
        Run `:=MiniIcons.list('extension')` to see them.
        This step also includes already cached extensions.
        Uses output of corresponding "extension" category.
      - Filetype as a result of |vim.filetype.match()|.
        Uses output of corresponding "filetype" category.

    Examples: >lua

      -- All of these will result in the same output
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', '~/.config/nvim/init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', '/home/user/.config/nvim/init.lua')

      -- Results in different output
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'Init.lua')
      MiniIcons.get('file', 'init.LUA')
<
  - `'filetype'` - icon data for 'filetype' values.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: any filetype that is reasonably used in Neovim ecosystem.
        This category is intended as a widest net for supporting use cases.
        Users are encouraged to have a specific filetype detection set up.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'lua')
      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'help')
      MiniIcons.get('filetype', 'minifiles')
<
  - `'lsp'` - icon data for various "LSP kind" values.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: only namesspace entries from LSP specification that are
        can be displayed to user. Like `CompletionItemKind`, `SymbolKind`, etc.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'array')
      MiniIcons.get('lsp', 'keyword')
<
  - `'os'` - icon data for popular operating systems.
    Icon names:
      - <Input>: any string.
      - <Built-in>: only operating systems which have `nf-md-*` class icon.

    Examples: >lua

      MiniIcons.get('os', 'linux')
      MiniIcons.get('os', 'arch')
      MiniIcons.get('os', 'macos')
<
{name} `(string)` Icon name within category. Use |MiniIcons.list()| to get icon
  names which are explicitly supported for specific category.

Return ~
`(string)` icon string
Return ~
`(string)` highlight group name it is
Return ~
`(boolean)` a boolean indicating whether this icon was returned as a
  result of fallback to default. Example: >lua

  -- Results into `icon='󰢱'`, `hl='MiniIconsAzure'`, `is_default=false`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'file.lua')

  -- Results into `icon='󰈔'`, `hl='MiniIconsGrey'`, `is_default=true`
  local icon, hl, is_default = MiniIcons.get('file', 'not-supported')
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniIcons.list()*
                          `MiniIcons.list`({category})
List explicitly supported icon names

Parameters ~
{category} `(string)` Category name supported by |MiniIcons.get()|.

Return ~
`(table)` Array of icon names which are explicitly supported for category.
  Note, that `'file'` and `'extension'` categories support much more icon names
  via their fallback to using |vim.filetype.match()| with `'filetype'` category.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            *MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()*
                      `MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons`()
Mock 'nvim-web-devicons' module

Call this function to mock exported functions of 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons'
plugin. It will mock all its functions which return icon data by
using |MiniIcons.get()| equivalent.

This function is useful if any plugins relevant to you depend solely on
'nvim-web-devicons' and have not yet added an integration with 'mini.icons'.

Full example of usage: >lua

  require('mini.icons').setup()
  MiniIcons.mock_nvim_web_devicons()
<
Works without installed 'nvim-web-devicons' and even with it installed (needs
to be called after 'nvim-web-devicons' is set up).
