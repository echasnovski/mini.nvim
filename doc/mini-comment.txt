*mini.comment* Comment lines

==============================================================================

Features:
- Commenting in Normal mode respects |count| and is dot-repeatable.

- Comment structure by default is inferred from 'commentstring': either
  from current buffer or from locally active tree-sitter language (only on
  Neovim>=0.9). It can be customized via `options.custom_commentstring`
  (see |MiniComment.config| for details).

- Allows custom hooks before and after successful commenting.

- Configurable options for some nuanced behavior.

What it doesn't do:
- Block and sub-line comments. This will only support per-line commenting.

- Handle indentation with mixed tab and space.

- Preserve trailing whitespace in empty lines.

Notes:
- To use tree-sitter aware commenting, global value of 'commentstring'
  should be `''` (empty string). This is the default value in Neovim>=0.9,
  so make sure to not set it manually.

# Setup~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.comment').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
`MiniComment` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
`:lua MiniComment.*`).

See |MiniComment.config| for `config` structure and default values.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minicomment_config` which should have same structure as
`MiniComment.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Disabling~

To disable core functionality, set `vim.g.minicomment_disable` (globally) or
`vim.b.minicomment_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
|mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

# Options ~

## Custom commentstring ~

`options.custom_commentstring` can be a function customizing 'commentstring'
option used to infer comment structure. It is called once before every
commenting action with the following arguments:
- `ref_position` - position at which to compute 'commentstring' (might be
  relevant for a text with locally different commenting rules). Its structure
  is the same as `opts.ref_position` in |MiniComment.toggle_lines()|.

Its output should be a valid 'commentstring' (string containing `%s`).

If not set or the output is `nil`, |MiniComment.get_commentstring()| is used.

For example, this option can be used to always use buffer 'commentstring'
even in case of present active tree-sitter parser: >

  require('mini.comment').setup({
    options = {
      custom_commentstring = function() return vim.bo.commentstring end,
    }
  })

                                                        *MiniComment.operator()*
                         `MiniComment.operator`({mode})
Main function to be mapped

It is meant to be used in expression mappings (see |map-<expr>|) to enable
dot-repeatability and commenting on range. There is no need to do this
manually, everything is done inside |MiniComment.setup()|.

It has a somewhat unintuitive logic (because of how expression mapping with
dot-repeatability works): it should be called without arguments inside
expression mapping and with argument when action should be performed.

Parameters~
{mode} `(string|nil)` Optional string with 'operatorfunc' mode (see |g@|).

Return~
`(string|nil)` 'g@' if called without argument, '' otherwise (but after
  performing action).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    *MiniComment.toggle_lines()*
          `MiniComment.toggle_lines`({line_start}, {line_end}, {opts})
Toggle comments between two line numbers

It uncomments if lines are comment (every line is a comment) and comments
otherwise. It respects indentation and doesn't insert trailing
whitespace. Toggle commenting not in visual mode is also dot-repeatable
and respects |count|.

Before successful commenting it executes `config.hooks.pre`.
After successful commenting it executes `config.hooks.post`.
If hook returns `false`, any further action is terminated.

# Notes ~

- Comment structure is inferred from buffer's 'commentstring' option or
  local language of tree-sitter parser (if active; only on Neovim>=0.9).

- Currently call to this function will remove marks inside written range.
  Use |lockmarks| to preserve marks.

Parameters~
{line_start} `(number)` Start line number (inclusive from 1 to number of lines).
{line_end} `(number)` End line number (inclusive from 1 to number of lines).
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <ref_position> `(table)` - A two-value array with `{ row, col }` (both
    starting at 1) of reference position at which 'commentstring' value
    will be computed. Default: `{ line_start, 1 }`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *MiniComment.textobject()*
                           `MiniComment.textobject`()
Select comment textobject

This selects all commented lines adjacent to cursor line (if it itself is
commented). Designed to be used with operator mode mappings (see |mapmode-o|).

Before successful selection it executes `config.hooks.pre`.
After successful selection it executes `config.hooks.post`.
If hook returns `false`, any further action is terminated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *MiniComment.get_commentstring()*
                `MiniComment.get_commentstring`({ref_position})
Get 'commentstring'

This function represents default approach of computing relevant
'commentstring' option in current buffer. Used to infer comment structure.

It has the following logic:
- (Only on Neovim>=0.9) If there is an active tree-sitter parser, try to get
  'commentstring' from the local language at `ref_position`.

- If first step is not successful, use buffer's 'commentstring' directly.

Parameters~
{ref_position} `(table)` Reference position inside current buffer at which
  to compute 'commentstring'. Same structure as `opts.ref_position`
  in |MiniComment.toggle_lines()|.

Return~
`(string)` Relevant value of 'commentstring'.
