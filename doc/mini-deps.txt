*mini.deps* Plugin manager
*MiniDeps*

==============================================================================

Features:

- Manage plugins utilizing Git and built-in |packages| with these actions:
    - Add plugin to current session, download if absent. See |MiniDeps.add()|.
    - Update with/without confirm, with/without parallel download of new data.
      See |MiniDeps.update()|.
    - Delete unused plugins with/without confirm. See |MiniDeps.clean()|.
    - Get / set / save / load snapshot. See `MiniDeps.snap_*()` functions.

    All main actions are available both as Lua functions and user commands
    (see |MiniDeps-commands|).

- Minimal yet flexible plugin |MiniDeps-plugin-specification|:
    - Plugin source.
    - Name of target plugin directory.
    - Checkout target: branch, commit, tag, etc.
    - Monitor branch to track updates without checking out.
    - Dependencies to be set up prior to the target plugin.
    - Hooks to call before/after plugin is created/changed.

- Helpers implementing two-stage startup: |MiniDeps.now()| and |MiniDeps.later()|.
  See |MiniDeps-overview| for how to implement basic lazy loading with them.

What it doesn't do:

- Manage plugins which are developed without Git. The suggested approach is
  to create a separate package (see |packages|).

- Provide ways to completely remove or update plugin's functionality in
  current session. Although this is partially doable, it can not be done
  in full (yet) because plugins can have untraceable side effects
  (autocmmands, mappings, etc.).
  The suggested approach is to restart Nvim.

# Dependencies ~

For most of its functionality this plugin relies on `git` CLI tool.
See https://git-scm.com/ for more information about how to install it.
Actual knowledge of Git is not required but helpful.

# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.deps').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniDeps`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniDeps.*`).

See |MiniDeps.config| for `config` structure and default values.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minideps_config` which should have same structure as
`MiniDeps.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Comparisons ~

- 'folke/lazy.nvim':
    - More feature-rich and complex.
    - Uses table specification with dedicated functions to add plugins,
      while this module uses direct function call approach
      (calling |MiniDeps.add()| ensures that plugin is usable).
    - Uses version tags by default, while this module is more designed towards
      tracking branches. Using tags is possible too (see |MiniDeps-overview|).

- 'savq/paq-nvim':
    - Overall less feature-rich than this module (by design).
    - Uses array of plugin specifications inside `setup()` call to define which
      plugins should be installed. Requires separate `:PaqInstall` call to
      actually install them. This module ensures installation on first load.

- 'junegunn/vim-plug':
    - Written in Vimscript, while this module is in Lua.
    - Similar approach to defining and installing plugins as 'savq/paq-nvim'.
    - Has basic lazy-loading built-in, while this module does not (by design).

# Highlight groups ~

Highlight groups are used inside confirmation buffers after
default |MiniDeps.update()| and |MiniDeps.clean()|.

* `MiniDepsChangeAdded`   - added change (commit) during update.
* `MiniDepsChangeRemoved` - removed change (commit) during update.
* `MiniDepsHint`          - various hints.
* `MiniDepsInfo`          - various information.
* `MiniDepsMsgBreaking`   - message for (conventional commit) breaking change.
* `MiniDepsPlaceholder`   - placeholder when there is no valuable information.
* `MiniDepsTitle`         - various titles.
* `MiniDepsTitleError`    - title when plugin had errors during update.
* `MiniDepsTitleSame`     - title when plugin has no changes to update.
* `MiniDepsTitleUpdate`   - title when plugin has changes to update.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

                                                             *MiniDeps-overview*
# Directory structure ~

This module uses built-in |packages| to make plugins usable in current session.
It works with "pack/deps" package inside `config.path.package` directory.

By default "opt" subdirectory is used to install optional plugins which are
loaded on demand with |MiniDeps.add()|.
Non-optional plugins in "start" subdirectory are supported but only if moved
there manually after initial install. Use it if you know what you are doing.

# Add plugin ~

Use |MiniDeps.add()| to add plugin to current session. Supply plugin's URL
source as a string or |MiniDeps-plugin-specification| in general. If plugin is
not present in "pack/deps" package, it will be created (a.k.a. installed)
before processing anything else.

The recommended way of adding a plugin is by calling |MiniDeps.add()| in the
|init.lua| file (make sure |MiniDeps.setup()| is called prior): >lua

  local add = MiniDeps.add

  -- Add to current session (install if absent)
  add({
    source = 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',
    -- Supply dependencies near target plugin
    depends = { 'williamboman/mason.nvim' },
  })

  add({
    source = 'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter',
    -- Use 'master' while monitoring updates in 'main'
    checkout = 'master',
    monitor = 'main',
    -- Perform action after every checkout
    hooks = { post_checkout = function() vim.cmd('TSUpdate') end },
  })
  -- Possible to immediately execute code which depends on the added plugin
  require('nvim-treesitter.configs').setup({
    ensure_installed = { 'lua', 'vimdoc' },
    highlight = { enable = true },
  })
<
NOTE:
- To increase performance, `add()` only ensures presence on disk and
  nothing else. In particular, it doesn't ensure `opts.checkout` state.
  Update or modify plugin state explicitly (see later sections).

# Lazy loading ~

Any lazy-loading is assumed to be done manually by calling |MiniDeps.add()|
at appropriate time. This module provides helpers implementing special safe
two-stage loading:
- |MiniDeps.now()| safely executes code immediately. Use it to load plugins
  with UI necessary to make initial screen draw.
- |MiniDeps.later()| schedules code to be safely executed later, preserving
  order. Use it (with caution) for everything else which doesn't need
  precisely timed effect, as it will be executed some time soon on one of
  the next event loops. >lua

  local now, later = MiniDeps.now, MiniDeps.later

  -- Safely execute immediately
  now(function() vim.cmd('colorscheme randomhue') end)
  now(function() require('mini.statusline').setup() end)

  -- Safely execute later
  later(function() require('mini.pick').setup() end)
<
# Update ~

To update plugins from current session with new data from their sources,
use |:DepsUpdate|. This will download updates (utilizing multiple cores) and
show confirmation buffer. Follow instructions at its top to finish an update.

NOTE: This updates plugins on disk which most likely won't affect current
session. Restart Nvim to have them properly loaded.

# Modify ~

To change plugin's specification (like set different `checkout`, etc.):
- Update corresponding |MiniDeps.add()| call.
- Run `:DepsUpdateOffline <plugin_name>`.
- Review changes and confirm.
- Restart Nvim.

NOTE: if `add()` prior used a single source string, make sure to convert
its argument to `{ source = '<previous_argument>', checkout = '<state>'}`

# Snapshots ~

Use |:DepsSnapSave| to save state of all plugins from current session into
a snapshot file (see `config.path.snapshot`).

Use |:DepsSnapLoad| to load snapshot. This will change (without confirmation)
state on disk. Plugins present in both snapshot file and current session
will be affected. Restart Nvim to see the effect.

NOTE: loading snapshot does not change plugin's specification defined inside
|MiniDeps.add()| call. This means that next update might change plugin's state.
To make it permanent, freeze plugin in target state manually.

# Freeze ~

Modify plugin's specification to have `checkout` pointing to a static
target: tag, state (commit hash), or 'HEAD' (to freeze in current state).

Frozen plugins will not receive updates. You can monitor any new changes from
its source by "subscribing" to `monitor` branch which will be shown inside
confirmation buffer after |:DepsUpdate|.

Example: use `checkout = 'v0.10.0'` to freeze plugin at tag "v0.10.0" while
monitoring new versions in the log from `monitor` (usually default) branch.

# Rollback ~

To roll back after an unfortunate update:
- Get identifier of latest working state:
    - Use |:DepsShowLog| to see update log, look for plugin's name, and copy
      identifier listed as "State before:".
    - See previously saved snapshot file for plugin's name and copy
      identifier next to it.
- Freeze plugin at that state while monitoring appropriate branch.
  Revert to previous shape of |MiniDeps.add()| call to resume updating.

# Remove ~

- Make sure that target plugin is not registered in current session.
  Usually it means removing corresponding |MiniDeps.add()| call.
- Run |:DepsClean|. This will show confirmation buffer with a list of plugins to
  be deleted from disk. Follow instructions at its top to finish cleaning.

Alternatively, manually delete plugin's directory from "pack/deps" package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *MiniDeps-plugin-specification*
# Plugin specification ~

Each plugin dependency is managed based on its specification (a.k.a. "spec").
See |MiniDeps-overview| for some examples.

Specification can be a single string which is inferred as:
- Plugin <name> if it doesn't contain "/".
- Plugin <source> otherwise.

Primarily, specification is a table with the following fields:

- <source> `(string|nil)` - field with URI of plugin source used during creation
  or update. Can be anything allowed by `git clone`.
  Default: `nil` to rely on source set up during install.
  Notes:
    - It is required for creating plugin, but can be omitted afterwards.
    - As the most common case, URI of the format "user/repo" is transformed
      into "https://github.com/user/repo".

- <name> `(string|nil)` - directory basename of where to put plugin source.
  It is put in "pack/deps/opt" subdirectory of `config.path.package`.
  Default: basename of <source> if it is present, otherwise should be
  provided explicitly.

- <checkout> `(string|nil)` - checkout target used to set state during update.
  Can be anything supported by `git checkout` - branch, commit, tag, etc.
  Default: `nil` for default branch (usually "main" or "master").

- <monitor> `(string|nil)` - monitor branch used to track new changes from
  different target than `checkout`. Should be a name of present Git branch.
  Default: `nil` for default branch (usually "main" or "master").

- <depends> `(table|nil)` - array of plugin specifications (strings or tables)
  to be added prior to the target.
  Default: `nil` for no dependencies.

- <hooks> `(table|nil)` - table with callable hooks to call on certain events.
  Possible hook names:
    - <pre_install>   - before creating plugin directory.
    - <post_install>  - after  creating plugin directory.
    - <pre_checkout>  - before making change in existing plugin.
    - <post_checkout> - after  making change in existing plugin.
  Each hook is executed with the following table as an argument:
    - <path> (`string`)   - absolute path to plugin's directory
      (might not yet exist on disk).
    - <source> (`string`) - resolved <source> from spec.
    - <name> (`string`)   - resolved <name> from spec.
  Default: `nil` for no hooks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *MiniDeps-commands*
# User commands ~

Note: Most commands have a Lua function alternative which they rely on.
Like |:DepsAdd| uses |MiniDeps.add()|, etc.

                                                                      *:DepsAdd*
`:DepsAdd user/repo` makes plugin from https://github.com/user/repo available
in the current session (also creates it, if it is not present).
`:DepsAdd name` adds already installed plugin `name` to current session.
Accepts only single string compatible with |MiniDeps-plugin-specification|.
To add plugin in every session, put |MiniDeps.add()| in |init.lua|.

                                                                   *:DepsUpdate*
`:DepsUpdate` synchronizes plugins with their session specifications and
updates them with new changes from sources. It shows confirmation buffer in
a separate |tabpage| with information about an upcoming update to review
and (selectively) apply. See |MiniDeps.update()| for more info.

`:DepsUpdate name` updates plugin `name`. Any number of names is allowed.

`:DepsUpdate!` and `:DepsUpdate! name` update without confirmation.
You can see what was done in the log file afterwards (|:DepsShowLog|).

                                                            *:DepsUpdateOffline*
`:DepsUpdateOffline` is same as |:DepsUpdate| but doesn't download new updates
from sources. Useful to only synchronize plugin specification in code and
on disk without unnecessary downloads.

                                                                  *:DepsShowLog*
`:DepsShowLog` opens log file to review.

                                                                    *:DepsClean*
`:DepsClean` deletes plugins from disk not added to current session. It shows
confirmation buffer in a separate |tabpage| with information about an upcoming
deletes to review and (selectively) apply. See |MiniDeps.clean()| for more info.

`:DepsClean!` deletes plugins without confirmation.

                                                                 *:DepsSnapSave*
`:DepsSnapSave` creates snapshot file in default location (see |MiniDeps.config|).
`:DepsSnapSave path` creates snapshot file at `path`.

                                                                 *:DepsSnapLoad*

`:DepsSnapLoad` loads snapshot file from default location (see |MiniDeps.config|).
`:DepsSnapLoad path` loads snapshot file at `path`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniDeps.setup()*
                           `MiniDeps.setup`({config})
Module setup

Calling this function creates user commands described in |MiniDeps-commands|.

Parameters ~
{config} `(table|nil)` Module config table. See |MiniDeps.config|.

Usage ~
>lua
  require('mini.deps').setup() -- use default config
  -- OR
  require('mini.deps').setup({}) -- replace {} with your config table
<
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               *MiniDeps.config*
                               `MiniDeps.config`
Module config

Default values:
>lua
  MiniDeps.config = {
    -- Parameters of CLI jobs
    job = {
      -- Number of parallel threads to use. Default: 80% of all available.
      n_threads = nil,

      -- Timeout (in ms) for each job before force quit
      timeout = 30000,
    },

    -- Paths describing where to store data
    path = {
      -- Directory for built-in package.
      -- All plugins are actually stored in 'pack/deps' subdirectory.
      package = vim.fn.stdpath('data') .. '/site',

      -- Default file path for a snapshot
      snapshot = vim.fn.stdpath('config') .. '/mini-deps-snap',

      -- Log file
      log = vim.fn.stdpath('log') .. '/mini-deps.log'
    },

    -- Whether to disable showing non-error feedback
    silent = false,
  }
<
# Job ~

`config.job` defines how CLI jobs are run.

`job.n_threads` is a maximum number of parallel jobs used when needed.
Default: 80% of all available.

`job.timeout` is a duration (in ms) from job start until it is forced to stop.
Default: 30000.

# Paths ~

`config.path` defines main paths used in this module.

`path.package` is a string with path inside which "pack/deps" package is stored
(see |MiniDeps-overview|).
Default: "site" subdirectory of "data" standard path (see |stdpath()|).

`path.snapshot` is a string with default path for snapshot.
See |:DepsSnapSave| and |:DepsSnapLoad|.
Default: "mini-deps-snap" file in "config" standard path (see |stdpath()|).

`path.log` is a string with path containing log of operations done by module.
In particular, it contains all changes done after making an update.
Default: "mini-deps.log" file in "log" standard path (see |stdpath()|).

# Silent ~

`config.silent` is a boolean controlling whether to suppress non-error feedback.
Default: `false`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *MiniDeps.add()*
                         `MiniDeps.add`({spec}, {opts})
Add plugin to current session

- Process specification by expanding dependencies into single spec array.
- Ensure plugin is present on disk along with its dependencies by installing
  (in parallel) absent ones:
    - Execute `opts.hooks.pre_install`.
    - Use `git clone` to clone plugin from its source URI into "pack/deps/opt".
    - Set state according to `opts.checkout`.
    - Execute `opts.hooks.post_install`.
- Register spec(s) in current session.
- Make sure plugin(s) can be used in current session (see |:packadd|).
- If not during startup and is needed, source all "after/plugin/" scripts.

Notes:
- Presence of plugin is checked by its name which is the same as the name
  of its directory inside "pack/deps" package (see |MiniDeps-overview|).
- To increase performance, this function only ensures presence on disk and
  nothing else. In particular, it doesn't ensure `opts.checkout` state.
  Use |MiniDeps.update()| or |:DepsUpdateOffline| explicitly.
- Adding plugin several times updates its session specs.

Parameters ~
{spec} `(table|string)` Plugin specification. See |MiniDeps-plugin-specification|.
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <bang> `(boolean)` - whether to use `:packadd!` instead of plain |:packadd|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *MiniDeps.update()*
                       `MiniDeps.update`({names}, {opts})
Update plugins

- Synchronize specs with state of plugins on disk (set `source`, etc.).
- Infer data before downloading updates.
- If not offline, download updates (in parallel).
- Infer data after downloading updates.
- If update is forced, apply all changes immediately while updating log
  file (at `config.path.log`; use |:DepsShowLog| to review).
  Otherwise show confirmation buffer with instructions on how to proceed.

Parameters ~
{names} `(table|nil)` Array of plugin names to update.
 Default: all plugins from current session (see |MiniDeps.get_session()|).
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <force> `(boolean)` - whether to force update without confirmation.
    Default: `false`.
  - <offline> `(boolean)` - whether to skip downloading updates from sources.
    Default: `false`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniDeps.clean()*
                            `MiniDeps.clean`({opts})
Clean plugins

- Compute absent plugins: not registered in current session
  (see |MiniDeps.get_session()|) but present on disk in dedicated "pack/deps"
  package (inside `config.path.package`).
- If cleaning is forced, delete all absent plugins from disk.
  Otherwise show confirmation buffer with instructions on how to proceed.

Parameters ~
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <force> `(boolean)` - whether to force delete without confirmation.
    Default: `false`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *MiniDeps.snap_get()*
                             `MiniDeps.snap_get`()
Compute snapshot

Return ~
`(table)` A snapshot table: plugin names as keys and state as values.
  All plugins in current session are processed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                           *MiniDeps.snap_set()*
                          `MiniDeps.snap_set`({snap})
Apply snapshot

Notes:
- Checking out states from snapshot does not update session plugin spec
  (`checkout` field in particular). Among others, it means that next call
  to |MiniDeps.update()| might override the result of this function.
  To make changes permanent, set `checkout` spec field to state from snapshot.

Parameters ~
{snap} `(table)` A snapshot table: plugin names as keys and state as values.
  Only plugins in current session are processed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *MiniDeps.snap_save()*
                          `MiniDeps.snap_save`({path})
Save snapshot

Parameters ~
{path} `(string|nil)` A valid path on disk where to write snapshot computed
  with |MiniDeps.snap_get()|.
  Default: `config.path.snapshot`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *MiniDeps.snap_load()*
                          `MiniDeps.snap_load`({path})
Load snapshot file

Notes from |MiniDeps.snap_set()| also apply here.

Parameters ~
{path} `(string|nil)` A valid path on disk from where to read snapshot.
  Default: `config.path.snapshot`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        *MiniDeps.get_session()*
                            `MiniDeps.get_session`()
Get session

Plugin is registered in current session if it either:
- Was added with |MiniDeps.add()| (preserving order of calls).
- Is a "start" plugin and present in 'runtimpath'.

Return ~
session `(table)` Array with specifications of all plugins registered in
  current session.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                *MiniDeps.now()*
                              `MiniDeps.now`({f})
Execute function now

Safely execute function immediately. Errors are shown with |vim.notify()|
later, after all queued functions (including with |MiniDeps.later()|)
are executed, thus not blocking execution of next code in file.

Assumed to be used as a first step during two-stage config execution to
load plugins immediately during startup. See |MiniDeps-overview|.

Parameters ~
{f} `(function)` Callable to execute.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              *MiniDeps.later()*
                             `MiniDeps.later`({f})
Execute function later

Queue function to be safely executed later without blocking execution of
next code in file. All queued functions are guaranteed to be executed in
order they were added.
Errors are shown with |vim.notify()| after all queued functions are executed.

Assumed to be used as a second step during two-stage config execution to
load plugins "lazily" after startup. See |MiniDeps-overview|.

Parameters ~
{f} `(function)` Callable to execute.
