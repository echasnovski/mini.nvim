# Setup ~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.operators').setup({})` (replace
`{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table `MiniOperators`
which you can use for scripting or manually (with `:lua MiniOperators.*`).

See |MiniOperators.config| for available config settings.

You can override runtime config settings (but not `config.mappings`) locally
to buffer inside `vim.b.minioperators_config` which should have same structure
as `MiniOperators.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Comparisons ~

- 'gbprod/substitute.nvim':
    - Has "replace" and "exchange" variants, but not others from this module.
    - Has "replace/substitute" over range functionality, while this module
      does not by design (it is similar to |:s| functionality while not
      offering significantly lower mental complexity).
    - "Replace" highlights pasted text, while in this module it doesn't.
    - "Exchange" doesn't work across buffers, while in this module it does.

- 'svermeulen/vim-subversive':
    - Main inspiration for "replace" functionality, so they are mostly similar
      for this operator.
    - Has "replace/substitute" over range functionality, while this module
      does not by design.

- 'tommcdo/vim-exchange':
    - Main inspiration for "exchange" functionality, so they are mostly
      similar for this operator.
    - Doesn't work across buffers, while this module does.

- 'christoomey/vim-sort-motion':
    - Uses |:sort| for linewise sorting, while this module uses consistent
      sorting algorithm (by default, see |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()|).
    - Sorting algorithm can't be customized, while this module allows this
      (see `sort.func` in |MiniOperators.config|).
    - For charwise region uses only commas as separators, while this module
      can also separate by semicolon or whitespace (by default,
      see |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()|).

# Highlight groups ~

* `MiniOperatorsExchangeFrom` - first region to exchange.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling ~

To disable main functionality, set `vim.g.minioperators_disable` (globally) or
`vim.b.minioperators_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
|mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes.

                                                        *MiniOperators-overview*
# General overview ~

Operator defines an action that will be performed on a textobject, motion,
or visual selection (similar to |d|, |c|, etc.). When makes sense, it can also
respect supplied register (like "replace" operator).

This module implements each operator in a separate dedicated function
(like |MiniOperators.replace()| for "replace" operator). Each such function
takes `mode` as argument and acts depending on it:

- If `mode` is `nil` (or not explicitly supplied), it sets |operatorfunc|
  to this dedicated function and returns `g@` assuming being called from
  expression mapping. See |:map-operator| and |:map-expression| for more details.

- If `mode` is "char", "line", or "block", it acts as `operatorfunc` and performs
  action for region between |`[| and |`]| marks.

- If `mode` is "visual", it performs action for region between |`<| and |`>| marks.

For more details about specific operator, see help for its function:

- Evaluate: |MiniOperators.evaluate()|
- Exchange: |MiniOperators.exchange()|
- Multiply: |MiniOperators.multiply()|
- Replace:  |MiniOperators.replace()|
- Sort:     |MiniOperators.sort()|

                                                        *MiniOperators-mappings*
## Mappings ~

All operators are automatically mapped during |MiniOperators.setup()| execution.
Mappings keys are deduced from `prefix` field of corresponding `config` entry.

For each operator the following mappings are created:

- In Normal mode to operate on textobject. Uses `prefix` directly.
- In Normal mode to operate on line. Appends to `prefix` the last character.
  This aligns with |operator-doubled| and established patterns for operators
  with more than two characters, like |guu|, |gUU|, etc.
- In Visual mode to operate on visual selection. Uses `prefix` directly.

Example of default mappings for "replace":
- `gr` in Normal mode for operating on textobject.
  Example of usage: `griw` replaces "inner word" with default register.
- `grr` in Normal mode for operating on line.
  Example of usage: `grr` replaces current line.
- `gr` in Visual mode for operating on visual selection.
  Example of usage: `viw` selects "inner word" and `gr` replaces it.

There are two suggested ways to customize mappings:

- Change `prefix` in |MiniOperators.setup()| call. For example, doing >

  require('mini.operators').setup({ replace = { prefix = 'cr' } })
<
  will make mappings for `cr`/`crr`/`cr` instead of `gr`/`grr`/`gr`.

- Disable automated mapping creation by supplying empty string as prefix and
  use |MiniOperators.make_mappings()| directly. For example: >

  -- Disable automated creation of "replace"
  local operators = require('mini.operators')
  operators.setup({ replace = { prefix = '' } })

  -- Make custom mappings
  operators.make_mappings(
    'replace',
    { textobject = 'cr', line = 'crr', selection = 'cr' }
  )

# Evaluate ~

`evaluate.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.

`evaluate.func` is a function used to actually evaluate text region.
If `nil` (default), |MiniOperators.default_evaluate_func()| is used.

This function will take content table representing selected text as input
and should return array of lines as output (each item per line).
Content table has fields `lines`, array of region lines, and `submode`,
one of `v`, `V`, `\22` (escaped `<C-v>`) for charwise, linewise, and blockwise.

To customize evaluation per language, set `evaluate.func` in buffer-local
config (`vim.b.minioperators_config`; see |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config|).

# Exchange ~

`exchange.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.

Note: default value "gx" overrides |netrw-gx| and |gx| / |v_gx|. If you prefer
using its original functionality, choose different `config.prefix`.

`exchange.reindent_linewise` is a boolean indicating whether newly put linewise
text should preserve indent of replaced text. In other words, if `false`,
regions are exchanged preserving their indents; if `true` - without them.

# Multiply ~

`multiply.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.

`multiply.func` is a function used to optionally update multiplied text.
If `nil` (default), text used as is.

Takes content table as input (see "Evaluate" section) and should return
array of lines as output.

# Replace ~

`replace.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.

`replace.reindent_linewise` is a boolean indicating whether newly put linewise
text should preserve indent of replaced text.

# Sort ~

`sort.prefix` is a string used to automatically infer operator mappings keys
during |MiniOperators.setup()|. See |MiniOperators-mappings|.

`sort.func` is a function used to actually sort text region.
If `nil` (default), |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()| is used.

Takes content table as input (see "Evaluate" section) and should return
array of lines as output.

Example of `sort.func` which asks user for custom delimiter for charwise region: >

  local sort_func = function(content)
    local opts = {}
    if content.submode == 'v' then
      -- Ask for delimiter to be treated as is (not as Lua pattern)
      local delimiter = vim.fn.input('Sort delimiter: ')
      -- Treat surrounding whitespace as part of split
      opts.split_patterns = { '%s*' .. vim.pesc(delimiter) .. '%s*' }
    end
    return MiniOperators.default_sort_func(content, opts)
  end

  require('mini.operators').setup({ sort = { func = sort_func } })

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *MiniOperators.evaluate()*
                        `MiniOperators.evaluate`({mode})
Evaluate text and replace with output

It replaces the region with the output of `config.evaluate.func`.
By default it is |MiniOperators.default_evaluate_func()| which evaluates
text as Lua code depending on the region submode.

Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `''block`, `'visual'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *MiniOperators.exchange()*
                        `MiniOperators.exchange`({mode})
Exchange text regions

Has two-step logic:
- First call remembers the region as the one to be exchanged and highlights it
  with `MiniOperatorsExchangeFrom` highlight group.
- Second call performs the exchange. Basically, a two substeps action:
  "yank both regions" and replace each one with another.

Notes:
- Use `<C-c>` to stop exchanging after the first step.

- Exchanged regions can have different (char,line,block)-wise submodes.

- Works with most cases of intersecting regions, but not officially supported.

Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `''block`, `'visual'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      *MiniOperators.multiply()*
                        `MiniOperators.multiply`({mode})
Multiply (duplicate) text

Copies a region (without affecting registers) and puts it directly after.

Notes:
- Supports two types of |[count]|: `[count1]gm[count2][textobject]` with default
  `config.multiply.prefix` makes `[count1]` copies of region defined by
  `[count2][textobject]`. Example: `2gm3aw` - 2 copies of `3aw`.

- |[count]| for "line" mapping (`gmm` by default) is treated as `[count1]` from
  previous note.

- Advantages of using this instead of "yank" + "paste":
   - Doesn't modify any register, while separate steps need some register to
     hold multiplied text.
   - In most cases separate steps would be "yank" + "move cursor" + "paste",
     while "multiply" makes it at once.

Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `''block`, `'visual'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                       *MiniOperators.replace()*
                        `MiniOperators.replace`({mode})
Replace text with register

Notes:
- Supports two types of |[count]|: `[count1]gr[count2][textobject]` with default
  `config.replace.prefix` puts `[count1]` contents of register over region defined
  by `[count2][textobject]`. Example: `2gr3aw` - 2 register contents over `3aw`.

- |[count]| for "line" mapping (`grr` by default) is treated as `[count1]` from
  previous note.

- Advantages of using this instead of "visually select" + "paste with |v_P|":
   - As operator it is dot-repeatable which has cumulative gain in case of
     multiple replacing is needed.
   - Can automatically reindent.

Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `''block`, `'visual'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          *MiniOperators.sort()*
                          `MiniOperators.sort`({mode})
Sort text

It replaces the region with the output of `config.sort.func`.
By default it is |MiniOperators.default_sort_func()| which sorts the text
depending on submode.

Notes:
- "line" mapping is charwise (as there is not much sense in sorting
  linewise a single line). This also results into no |[count]| support.

Parameters ~
{mode} `(string|nil)` One of `nil`, `'char'`, `'line'`, `''block`, `'visual'`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                 *MiniOperators.make_mappings()*
           `MiniOperators.make_mappings`({operator_name}, {lhs_tbl})
Make operator mappings

Parameters ~
{operator_name} `(string)` Name of existing operator from this module.
{lhs_tbl} `(table)` Table with mappings keys. Should have these fields:
  - <textobject> `(string)` - Normal mode mapping to operate on textobject.
  - <line> `(string)` - Normal mode mapping to operate on line.
    Usually an alias for textobject mapping followed by |_|.
    For "sort" it operates charwise on whole line without left and right
    whitespace (as there is not much sense in sorting linewise a single line).
  - <selection> `(string)` - Visual mode mapping to operate on selection.

  Supply empty string to not create particular mapping. Note: creating `line`
  mapping needs `textobject` mapping to be set.

Usage ~
>
  require('mini.operators').make_mappings(
    'replace',
    { textobject = 'cr', line = 'crr', selection = 'cr' }
  )

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         *MiniOperators.default_evaluate_func()*
                `MiniOperators.default_evaluate_func`({content})
Default evaluate function

Evaluate text as Lua code and return object from last line (like if last
line is prepended with `return` if it is not already).

Behavior depends on region submode:

- For charwise and linewise regions, text evaluated as is.

- For blockwise region, lines are evaluated per line using only first lines
  of outputs. This allows separate execution of lines in order to provide
  something different compared to linewise region.

Parameters ~
{content} `(table)` Table with the following fields:
  - <lines> `(table)` - array with content lines.
  - <submode> `(string)` - region submode. One of `'v'`, `'V'`, `'<C-v>'` (escaped).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             *MiniOperators.default_sort_func()*
              `MiniOperators.default_sort_func`({content}, {opts})
Default sort function

Sort text based on region submode:

- For charwise region, split by separator pattern, sort parts, merge back
  with separators. Actual pattern is inferred based on the array of patterns
  from `opts.split_patterns`: whichever element is present in the text is
  used, preferring the earlier one if several are present.
  Example: sorting "c, b; a" line with default `opts.split_patterns` results
  into "b; a, c" as it is split only by comma.

- For linewise and blockwise regions sort lines as is.

Notes:
- Sort is done with |table.sort()| on an array of lines, which doesn't treat
  whitespace or digits specially. Use |:sort| for more complicated tasks.

- Pattern is allowed to be an empty string in which case split results into
  all characters as parts.

- Pad pattern in `split_patterns` with `%s*` to include whitespace into separator.
  Example: line "b _ a" with "_" pattern will be sorted as " a_b " (because
  it is split as "b ", "_", " a" ) while with "%s*_%s*" pattern it results
  into "a _ b" (split as "b", " _ ", "a").

Parameters ~
{content} `(table)` Table with the following fields:
  - <lines> `(table)` - array with content lines.
  - <submode> `(string)` - region submode. One of `'v'`, `'V'`, `'<C-v>'` (escaped).
{opts} `(table|nil)` Options. Possible fields:
  - <compare_fun> `(function)` - compare function compatible with |table.sort()|.
    Default: direct compare with `<`.
  - <split_patterns> `(table)` - array of split Lua patterns to be used for
    charwise submode. Order is important.
    Default: `{ '%s*,%s*', '%s*;%s*', '%s+', '' }`.
