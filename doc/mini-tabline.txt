                                                                   *MiniTabline*
Minimal and fast tabline showing listed buffers. General idea: show all
listed buffers in readable way with minimal total width. Also allow showing
extra information section in case of multiple vim tabpages.

Features:
- Buffers are listed in the order of their identifier (see |bufnr()|).
- Different highlight groups for "states" of buffer affecting 'buffer tabs'.
- Buffer names are made unique by extending paths to files or appending
  unique identifier to buffers without name.
- Current buffer is displayed "optimally centered" (in center of screen
  while maximizing the total number of buffers shown) when there are many
  buffers open.
- 'Buffer tabs' are clickable if Neovim allows it.

What it doesn't do:
- Custom buffer order is not supported.

# Dependencies~

Suggested dependencies (provide extra functionality, tabline will work
without them):
- Plugin 'nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons' for filetype icons near the buffer
  name. If missing, no icons will be shown.

# Setup~

This module needs a setup with `require('mini.tabline').setup({})`
(replace `{}` with your `config` table). It will create global Lua table
`MiniTabline` which you can use for scripting or manually (with
`:lua MiniTabline.*`).

See |MiniTabline.config| for `config` structure and default values.

You can override runtime config settings locally to buffer inside
`vim.b.minitabline_config` which should have same structure as
`MiniTabline.config`. See |mini.nvim-buffer-local-config| for more details.

# Highlight groups~

* `MiniTablineCurrent` - buffer is current (has cursor in it).
* `MiniTablineVisible` - buffer is visible (displayed in some window).
* `MiniTablineHidden` - buffer is hidden (not displayed).
* `MiniTablineModifiedCurrent` - buffer is modified and current.
* `MiniTablineModifiedVisible` - buffer is modified and visible.
* `MiniTablineModifiedHidden` - buffer is modified and hidden.
* `MiniTablineFill` - unused right space of tabline.
* `MiniTablineTabpagesection` - section with tabpage information.

To change any highlight group, modify it directly with |:highlight|.

# Disabling~

To disable (show empty tabline), set `vim.g.minitabline_disable` (globally) or
`vim.b.minitabline_disable` (for a buffer) to `true`. Considering high number
of different scenarios and customization intentions, writing exact rules
for disabling module's functionality is left to user. See
|mini.nvim-disabling-recipes| for common recipes. Note: after disabling,
tabline is not updated right away, but rather after dedicated event (see
|events| and `MiniTabline` |augroup|).
