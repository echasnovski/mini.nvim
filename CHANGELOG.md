    - Linewise adding places surrounding parts on separate lines while indenting surrounded lines once.
    - Deleting surrounding which looks like a result of linewise adding will act to revert it: delete lines with surrounding parts and dedent surrounded lines once.
    - Blockwise adding places surrounding parts on whole edges, not only start and end of selection.


# Version 0.7.0

## mini.indentscope

- BREAKING: `MiniIndentscopePrefix` is now not used (deprecated). It was initially introduced as a way to properly show scope indicator on empty lines. It had a drawback of overshadowing 'listchars' symbols (see #125) and vertical guides from 'lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim'. As the other implementation approach was found by @mivort (see #161), `MiniIndentscopePrefix` is no longer needed and no overshadowing is done.
- BREAKING: `MiniIndentscope.gen_animation` is now a table (for consistency with other `gen_*` functions in 'mini.nvim'). See "Migrate from function type" section of `:h MiniIndentscope.gen_animation`. Calling it as function will be available until next release.

## mini.misc

## mini.align

Introduction of new module.

## mini.base16

- FEATURE: Add support for many plugin integrations.
- FEATURE: Implement `MiniBase16.config.plugins` for configuring plugin integrations.
- BREAKING: Change some 'mini.nvim' highlights:
    - `MiniCompletionActiveParameter` now highlights with background instead of underline.
    - `MiniJump2dSpot` now explicitly defined to use plugin's palette.
    - `MiniStarterItemPrefix` and `MiniStarterQuery` are now bold for better visibility.
- BREAKING: Update highlight for changed git diff to be more visible and to comply more with general guidelines.

## mini.jump

- BREAKING: Allow cursor to be positioned past the end of previous/current line (#113).

## mini.map

Introduction of new module.

## mini.starter

- Item evaluation is now prepended with query reset, as it is rarely needed any more (#105).
- All hooks are now called with `(content, buf_id)` signature allowing them properly use current window layout.

## mini.surround

- BREAKING FEATURE: update 'mini.surround' to share as much with 'mini.ai' as possible. This provides more integrated experience while enabling more useful features. Details:
    - Custom surrounding specification for input action has changed. Instead of `{ find = <string>, extract = <string> }` it is now `{ <function or composed pattern> }`. Previous format will work until the next release. See more in help file.
    - Algorithm for finding surrounding is now more powerful. It allows searching for more complex surroundings (via composed patterns or array of region pairs) and respects `v:count`.
    - Multiline input and output surroundings are now supported.
    - Opening brackets (`(`, `[`, `{`, `<`) now include whitespace in surrounding: input surrounding selects all inner edge whitespace, output surrounding is padded with single space.
    - Surrounding identifier `i` ("interactive") is soft deprecated in favor of `?` ("user prompt").
    - New surrounding aliases:
        - `b` for "brackets". Input - any of balanced `()`, `[]` `{}`. Output - `()`.
        - `q` for "quotes". Input - any of `"`, `'`, `` ` ``. Output - `""`.
    - Three new search methods `'prev'`, `'next'`, and `'nearest'` for finding non-covering previous and next surrounding.
- BREAKING FEATURE: Implement "last"/"next" extended mappings which force `'prev'` or `'next'` search method. Controlled with `config.mappings.suffix_last` and `config.mappings.suffix_next`respectively. This also means that custom surroundings with identifier equal to "last"/"next" mappings suffixes (defaults to 'l' and 'n') will work only with long enough delay after typing action mapping.
- FEATURE: Implement `MiniSurround.gen_spec` with generators of common surrounding specifications (like `MiniSurround.gen_spec.input.treesitter` for tree-sitter based input surrounding).


# Version 0.5.0

- Update all tests to use new 'mini.test' module.

## mini.starter

- FEATURE: Now it is possible to open multiple Starter buffers at the same time (#82). This comes with several changes which won't affect most users:
    - BREAKING: `MiniStarter.content` is deprecated. Use `MiniStarter.get_content()`.
    - All functions dealing with Starter buffer now have `buf_id` as argument (no breaking behavior).

## mini.statusline

- FEATURE: Implement `config.use_icons` which controls whether to use icons by default.

## mini.test

Introduction of new module.

- FEATURE: Implement idle timeout to stop jumping automatically (@annenpolka, #56).

- BREAKING: Deprecate `config.funname_pattern` option in favor of manually modifying `f` surrounding.
- BREAKING: Always move cursor to the right of left surrounding in `add()`, `delete()`, and `replace()` (instead of moving only if it was on the same line as left surrounding).
- Update process of getting user input: allow `<C-c>` to cancel and make empty string a valid input.

## mini.tabline

- FEATURE: Implement `config.tabpage_section`.
- BREAKING: Show listed buffers also in case of multiple tabpages (instead of using builtin behavior).

Note, that this has a minor break of previous behavior: now `MiniPairs.bs()` and `MiniPairs.cr()` don't have any input argument. But default behavior didn't change.
    - Allow setting global pair mappings inside `config` of `MiniPairs.setup()`.
